 Have done tapas here.   Must.  Get.  Ham croquettes.   Those stuffed plantains.  Lollipop chicken good, ribs good, Cuban sandwich ace, empanadas solid.  Reasonably priced, service attentive, nice walkway restaurant. 4.0 I heard place multiple people past two three years somehow paid visit I bitterly regret. A friend took lunch recent Thursday I simply amazed: entrance way plate I felt transported little Cuba Florida. The atmosphere decorum place distract everyday; music, waiters FOOD complete job taking vacation. The experience amazing two days later I returned dinner place disappoint. The food dancing flavors, attractively plated generous portions one could share. The menu impressive variety waiters know well happy navigate you. I can't wait return another culinary excursion! 5.0 I came dinner weeknight around six seated immediately. Although place big feels small warm. Saying loud understatement.

Parking usually issue pulled rite front building walked in. We seated rite away location turned seemed loudest area entire restaurant I even hear boyfriend speaking me. I ordered tapas last time chicken lollipops, goat cheese fritters, plantanos rellenos, beef empenadas. The chicken lollipops bland I asked waiter hot sauce 5 times actually brought table. I felt flavor first time I tried them. The goat cheese fritters seemed sweeter last time I I feel could use something else much goat cheese flavor. The empenadas (beef) flaky delicious consistent along plantanos rellenos. My main disappointment size churrasco. The first time I came ordered portion huge, time much. My steak maybe 2 inches wide ity bity. I taken picture compare I really unhappy. My boyfriend ordered cuban pete's paella said lacking flavor ok.

I like layout restaurant, chicken cooked way I better food places. That's I give three star. I go back try something different. 3.0 Cuban Pete's wonderful restaurant Montclair.  Be warned: take reservations gets crowded, especially Friday Saturday evenings spring summertime. It worth wait though atmosphere good food.  I usually get vaca frita (crispy shredded beef onions lime).  The portions generous I like lime flavor stands dish. It served rice, black beans plantains. I've tried many tapas well including croquetas mini Cuban sandwiches.  Inside mood lively music loud. The wait staff sings fun happy birthday song well customers celebrating there. 5.0 Go lunch. It nearly loud. The white sangria excellent, even without alcohol. Pork excellent, steak ok normal. I'd stick appetizers. 5.0 I hate disagree many fellow yelpers joint OVER RATED. The food subpar, service so-so, atmosphere unimpressive. Except courtyard. The courtyard lovely. If bring food, wonderful place dine. 2.0 4 stars great atmosphere, and, cubaccino "delicioso". I love setup place perfect dates. It transport Havana Cuba, definitely feel somewhere else. Music loud nothing less expect Cuban restaurant. The drinks good, get jar $14 dollars refreshing.

The downside get pretty noisy. 4.0 What fun place!  This must area.  This establishment BYOB.  They pitchers sangria's etc add alcohol bring.  My friend I went Saturday night seated promptly.  We ordered several tapas share.  I papas rellenas delicious always  I 've ropa vieja past hard order time since I wanted try something new.  I ceviche made tigerfish citrus.  It refreshing perfect summer.  I little disappointed stuffed plantains.  I felt barely stuffing little dry.  The garlic shrimp must. I practically licked plate. The atmosphere fun decor colorful vibrant.  It loud inside servers played bongos sang several tables birthday celebrations.  Being Saturday night, expected course. The service great waiter always available.  I can't wait return! 4.0 Very busy, bit pricey, worth money, food tasty. I Friday night May weather nice got sit outside. The wait almost 2 hours though, go walk ready take us in. It packed sat someone else table, bit awkward first, joked double date enjoyed rest evening. I heard always packed weekend, mind others looking shoulder eat definitely go :) It's Boomfield Ave, challenge find parking. 4.0 Excellent good food!!! fun times. I recommend marinated chicken breast black beans coconut rice along plantains.  It BYOB bring bottle sangria!!! 5.0 For food fantastic..i would given 5 stars, see jerk call owner...so inappropriate people staff...its sad miserable is...if ever place fails, him!!! 1.0 Went 21st birthday! The food good! The atmosphere upbeat sang me. There sangria really good! Just make sure get early u want avoid wait! 5.0 I went group 12 people birthday.  Before, us restaurant,  the manager told friends leave. When seated, waiter served us drinks 30 minutes.  After feeling hungry, ask waiter take order. The waiter friendly all- actually came bit snobby. Since friend's birthday, request "mini band" made. But, decided preform another group customers instead us. The waiter claimed band "performed" us. Last , least waiter gave wrong amount check claimed correct. He adamant orders. Then manager came proved waiter wrong. After long waiting, amount check still wrong misread numbers calculator. To sum up, restaurant poor customer service. 1.0 I've place numerous times I feel like I come here, less service I receive! Food great price,great late night hours. Just hope turnover servers causing downfall restaurant. 3.0 Get early- place lively however waiting method needs looked at.  Your crowded area waiting table standing  people eat. 4.0 Where I start.  Extremely rude staff I assume manager unhelpful disrespectful.   It almost like want money.  Apps good (that's got 1 star)  main course really bad.  It tasted looked sat heat lamp hours.  My wife's lechon completely dry chicken verge weapon overcooked dry.  Both sauces 0 flavor maduros extremly dry. All I know fuss subpar food extremly rude waitstaff manager mean I never go back 1.0 O.K. come times time seems less interesting next. They take reservations - to. This place always busy. The sangria's great cause add poison. The ensalada miami best little refreshing salad I've ever had. Not many times I rave salad. This salad one husband enjoy. The empanadas good. The seafood paella husband fave dish guess said time we've visited dish good smaller taste slightly changed - banana leaf. The pollo la plancha good, great bu good. The armando's beachfront grill baby back rib seems like fat ribs. The first time I ordered baby back ribs seems short ribs, Overall, taken many town guests like like party type atmosphere get swept frenzy. But, us locals people know type food good fun place visit. 3.0 This place incredible favorite friends tried must. 5.0 When place first opened, I time. Slowly, surely, fell off. And continues disappoint. Not sure I ever return honest. To give Cuban Pete's credit deserves, amazing Cuban setting. Palm trees, coconuts, paintings, even uniforms, add Cuban feel. But noise level kicks in, realize, can't even hear person infront you. The music extremely LOUD, people naturally raise voice, almost becomes unbearable. Anyone knows me, knows I loud person; say weird. Then birthday celebration (which many), even louder banging drums group men singing spanish. The food lacking. Nothing amazing nothing brag about. Apps good, I would say theyre better actual meals. Steak cooked, Ropa Veja flavor. The bacon wrapped dates really good tho! Our server nice but, order apps without placing entree order time. What?! We starving werent ready meals! We felt like almost rude... I get may way expediate table turn around thinking quality quantity? Thanks thanks Cuban Petes. 2.0 cuban food amazing! . b.y.o.b. 5.0 Stopped visiting New Jersey try Cuban food first time. The entrance confusing... idea walk restaurant. It palm trees everywhere walk in, duck get inside... Odd... otherwise would smacking face palm trees. Honestly, palm tree arch taller trees separated little entrance.. Upon arrival, idea go.. We walk middle restaurant get seated... Most places entrance. I definitely super confused.. Alright menu... reminded Mexican restaurant twist. I wanted try enchilado jumbo shrimp, ran jumbo shrimp. Sad day. Instead I got rice pulled beef... The food portions HUGE served clay bowls. The dishware middle table vase. They also serve community beans dishes. The food good, service subpar.. thirsty.. I trying conserve sprite... I could drink pace I served. 3.0 Fun atmosphere, good food, great music! A nice break usual american, italian.... restaurants.  Will definitely go back. 4.0 The food delicious beware wait time weekends.  They also take reservations first come first served.  We waited roughly hour half saturday night.  All aside, food fantastic.  Also great atmosphere, like quiet dinner.  There many large parties also BYOB many loud people.  Overall, food great atmosphere fun exciting.  Definitely must try!!!!! 4.0 I like place, I'm actually giving 2.5, I'm rounding 3 potential has. I ever come back though, due many negatives I list. Let's start ambiance. It's nice festive. The place definitely stands among restaurants street. The entrance really cool, surrounded trees. It's like walking forest jungle. It get annoying tall need duck, shorties (me included), we're good. Once walk past trees though, wild, good sense. I came Thursday night, pretty late too, around 8 pm. So naturally, I expected place pretty empty. That case. The place PACKED, way beyond capacity. All seats filled forced wait half hour table. That's bad part. The bad part there's waiting area whatsoever. No matter stand wait, always way. Always. There's way avoid it. We seated half hour promised. The server tried best could, honestly, many tables look attentive. Could sign need hire staff, sayin'. The worst paid credit cards. He took check come back half hour later. Now, I'm sure wondering food & drinks. We shared pitcher sangria. It delicious fresh, where's alcohol? They could've put grape juice would've same. As food, really good. I ordered pork rice fried plantains. Everyone table pretty much enjoyed food. I think worth price I paid though. I know better cuban places cheaper prices higher quality food closer I live. Also, sketchy walking around Bloomfield night. I mind homeless people, they're walking around yelling screaming, get kind scary. I even seen happen Manhattan Queens (where I grew up). If want read entire review, here's short version: Food good, worth price I paid. Sangria fresh tasty, barely alcohol it. No waiting area. Staff attentive; need hire people Decor really nice. They live music. When I say that, I mean servers banging drums hitting utensils metal cups 30 seconds. Yeah. Huge potential, unless make drastic changes, back again. 3.0 The food restaurant might come wait.  My girlfriend I first came restaurant recommendation friend. We greeted large group customers waiting around hostess.  When asked long wait would be, said 45 mins.  Time went slowly, partially due amazing food passing wait table.  We eventually got seated crowded dining room.  Our waiter took little bit get order whelmed customers had.  But food finally came out, absolutely delicious. My fiance ox tail tender fell bone I roast pork full flavor. In conclusion, come back restaurant food good. However, never go busy hour.  We normally go lunch early dinner. We seated right away food good. 4.0 If checking reviews food, food great.  But overall experience brought 2.  My complaints stem isolated incident, yes I find value reviews either.   Come early prepared wait.  If wait, really waiting area.  The waiters waitresses constantly move end way.   The place nice feel it.  Authentic west indies furniture setting.  They play music every 15min 30min get excessive.  Now must seating hundreds place.  It gets very, VERY loud.  I know management desperately needs revenue, tell do.   The ticket time 30 min that's beyond range.  Our waiter took long taking order,serving, collecting bill.  I blame place seats absurd amount people.     The food brings redemption.  Great drinks, great menu, great tasting food.  It bit pricey however.  If like rice,beans, plantains like sure.       i'd like give place 3, prices make give 2.  The cheapest  entrees start $15.  I'm Bloomfield side Montclair. If I'm paying prices experience well beyond this.  I get better quality experience NYC prices.   TL:DR Great food, high prices lots waiting leave annoyed all. 2.0 Really good spot dates even small outing friends. BYOB-they sell mixed juices drinks mix liquor with. The food served pretty quickly, tale awhile get dessert get bill.NO reservations all. ON weekend youre probably gonna waiting awhile. Siting outside nice, bit stuffy. Coconut rice delicious. spinach cheese empanadas amazing. Deff one faves ive ever tried. I wasnt crazy goat cheese nuggets, need something else inside them..way much goat cheese. The cod fritters good, especially $4--youll get 6 little balls fish. dare make room dessert--get tres leches. absolutely amazing!  i love it. 4.0 Some prior review stands. It's overcrowded.  It's really Sangria--though concoctions quite tasty. The tight quarters hustle/bustle makes service difficult--though there's real excuse stroll times refill water glasses. Having rethought it, really get quite bang buck. I'm sure things changed I simply misjudged past.   Two adults 2 kids $50-60 decent value. Is outstanding, authentic Cuban food?  I go far, certainly get good meal. Big crowds seating play pretty big factor here. No reservations, may long wait--especially parties 5 more. The lack waiting space, host stand center restaurant make navigation difficult.  To seat, bathroom. Couple tight seating, may find getting frequently bumped jostled patrons staff alike.  Pick table seating position carefully... 3.0 Wanted find good place dine birthday random google search landed here. Assumed small place blown away entrance dining effect amazing ambience string lights, al fresco dining, live drum beat music revving feel, energy packed summery place! Felt right Cuban planet feel like I jersey hours. Great service, delicious tapas, amazing place! Best montclair! 5.0 I first generation cuban I must say I love place. The food reminds home, I get visit working many hours. When I want treat great meal I missing home place. The fall, wait insane certain hours. The place BYOB location order drinks expecting any. As quality use home made drinks average. 4.0 Cuban Petes kind place I believe people come atmosphere. It beautifully decorated inside outside seating area gorgeous.  You enter walking thru friends jokingly called "the jungle." Immediately immersed chaotic, yet warm, somewhat traditional atmosphere. Warning! This place gets packed like nothing I seen NJ!  My journey restroom felt somewhat like sabatical! Despite crowd, service remarkably fast. It also loud.  Good groups, bad date.  It also byob. As food I got Chicken Carlitos way.  The chicken nice, tender, juicy! The seasoning bit sweet taste.  If personal tastes food, place easily 4 stars. I also manchengo cheese spinach empanadas I enjoyed.   I think I different expectations cuban food. Ive lot food latin cultures, spicy rather sweet. But cuban friend assured food prepared mostly traditionally. Overall I say go experience friendly staff.  Grab bottle go.  Just prepared shove crowds! 3.0 Everybody Montclair talks place, really cant see special :/ decor pretty caribbean also ambiance warm perfect forget little horrible cold weather. But food impressive. The portions huge u share 2, flavorful? Ehh not! We ordered lechon asado, (pork), rice beans. It tasteless dry, husband order salt pepper. I think authentic cuban food, sparkle it. Maybe luck day, early lunch. 3.0 Literally favorite restaurant entire world. I've eaten 4 times summer great. I usually get Ricky Ricardo's Ribs boneless short ribs apricot sauce. It's reallllyyyy good I love it. It sweetness around really good. It comes rice black beans Yuca latin potato also good. As tapas I've chicharon de pollo chicken lollipops. They're really good bit salty. I've also chicken empanadas. Now I've homemade empanadas various places I can't say best ones I've ever had. The drinks flavors great BYOB they'll mix sangrias you. The atmosphere fun waiters friendly. It get little crowded especially winter outside open. Most times pretty close people next restaurant get pretty loud. The reason I give 5 stars noise level people music make hard hear one another. But overall wondering restaurant I genuinely enjoy eating there. 4.0 I've cuban pete's twice.  I got sandwich first time; pretty good nothing special.  I liked crunch plantains came sandwich lot.   The second time I got pollo cubano, flavored really well.  The garlic sauce delicious.  However, chicken seriously dry.  I barely ate really unappetizing.  The rice black beans good.   I also watermelon sangria, strong tasted really sweet.  I enjoyed though.   The ambiance fun entrance way made feel like I entering restaurant Cuba. 2.0 I loveeeee here! Ropa Veja & coconut shrimp best! Bring mixed sangria mojito! Street & meter parking. The owner doll always accommodating! Fun lively Saturday night kind place ! 5.0 Amazing ambience, always packed. Super hard find table must go want amazing cuban experience. Food decent, meet expectations, still good nonetheless. Would recommend. 3.0 Good food Reasonable price Good customer service Great ambiance Loud fun Expect wait weekends Bring red wine rum Bring friends family Parking behind place Fullerton $5 5.0 Absolutely love place! Service always whenever I come food delicious I give rat's ass. I always go churrasco staple since flavorful. The portion give nothing sneeze either, though. If ever find hungry Montclair, good option many great food options around. Heads up, byob make sure come prepared. 5.0 The ever busy Cuban Pete's surely established one easily crowded restaurants Bloomfield Ave., good reasons. This review first time visit, countless times we've eaten food truly good. I usually get Cuban Pete's paella, comes decent amount seafood, boyfriend gets Rabo Encendido (oxtails). The food comes good portion want always ask side chimichurri churrasco sauce. This place gets four stars two reasons, one ambience actually something I appreciate. The music jarringly loud point can't even hear talking. Two, place quickly becomes disorganized weekend nights. Overall, great food good prices, I would suggest go weekday afternoon night want deal weekend crowd; trust worth it. 4.0 I love place. It cute place. I love walk side building. The food always good. It get loud, especially celebration. I went engagement situation. They hype. Anyhow, BYOB always enjoy food. Always! 4.0 I every Sunday , I love place.  Good food , service good , get pretty busy weekends 4 thou .. Over nice ... The ambience cool , palm trees Cuban decor . 5.0 When I younger I used go small Cuban restaurant near home closed couple years back. I've searching authentic Cuban food ever since I came Cuban Petes! Food delicious!! I ordered Rabo Encendido aka Oxtail Stew. It mouthwatering. It came rice, black beans, plantain. Not enjoying exquisite food decor makes feel like walking tropical island. The waiters dressed guayaberas (mens shirt popular Cuba) fedora hats adds cool tropical island feeling. 4.0 Great food, mediocre service, way loud, bad parking situation. The food phenomenal though. Fun parties. 3.0 Not good date night. Music SO LOUD caused neighboring tables talk LOUDER. The best part waiter shouting table ask neighboring table needed hot sauce. Really? Food pretty good, I felt rushed order rushed finish, took away all. The waiters moved quickly I afraid move I'd whacked face. Ironically, took forever get check. 2.0 I psyched going Cuban Pete's I never heard ALL great was. I really enjoyed food, good...from apps entrees, point. You really mood type experience...for example...waiting two hours table standing top people waiting people eating....so loud can't hear person across you....open air seating means AC room dined HOT (I hate sweating eating)....you screaming order server (since loud)....getting rushed like cattle could turn table. Our server super quick take orders, tell us apps/entrees come together, throw us check declined dessert. Again, none bothered I knew expect reading fellow yelp reviews...like I said, experience. I would def go back night/maybe lunch I relax totally insane (like weekends). Def give go! 3.0 Go, go back, then......go again!  One BEST Cuban restaurants tri-state area.  Did I mention go should.  Try coconut rice instead plain white rice. 5.0 Last month I friends visiting town brought straight lunch picking airport. As always food point & delicious. They loved it. 5.0 Atmosphere cute.  Definitely loud place though.  Don't expect deep, meaningful conversations unless willing lose voice. It's BYOB - beer wine only.  We brought bottle rum add mojitos waiter told us technically allowed.  I'm thinking even mojitos sangria bc they're great.  They taste like bottled mix incredibly sour (the woman next us said sangria overly sweet also). The food tasty reasonably priced.  Things worth trying:  chicharron de pollo, bocaditos de sandwich cubano, croquettes anything coconut rice.  S'gooood. 3.0 I found Cuban Pete's fun place good service food ok. It's cool place hang friends. This first visit I shall return. Well, I give 3 half bow ties 7 food okay, best Cuban food I had. 3.0 Great place, byob. Music always loud prepared speak up. Has great outdoor seating, good bday dinners. Food always good. This particular time waiter took way long take order, check meal plus dropping check. It pain hunt felt like bothering him. 4.0 Overall, Cuban Pete's overrated restaurant. If want quality Cuban food, I suggest find another restaurant Union City Paterson. The food restaurant nothing spectacular, price portion ratio justified. I Pollo Cubano suppose boneless according menu. The chicken dry taste half plate plantain. Least mention, I given cheap parts chicken, leg thigh. The restaurant lower prices increase portion size order find value going Cuban Pete's. On positive note, wait service good. Although food took served, waiter nice attending needs. Also, ambiance restaurant quite unique feel like transported Havana. I believe Cuban Pete's builds lot hype fact located trendy neighborhood Montclair. My recommendation people thinking going Cuban Pete's nice place good experience food. However, come high expectations food itself! 3.0 Food outrageously great! So wait table sometimes. LOL Do favor order "to go" The line long. Calling ahead real time saver, pretty quick ordering person, well. Service spotty busy, often, I gotta admit I dream beef stew. It like Abuela used make. Big tender chunks flavorful meat right amount fat potatoes. Served rice black beans, maduro (ripe, sweet fried plantain). Yumm-friggin-y It's good, anything else menu since ordering beef stew. Liquor store nearby. BYOB. Fee uncorking/BYOB'ing. They must give free dessert birthday, least 20 hours there. ID check, anyone? It almost became birthday too! (If I full) Other good stuff: stuffed dates wrapped bacon. Empanadas. Whole Red snapper. Parking challenge, worth walk. Entering place like tropical vacation. Great decor! 4.0 There literally hundreds reviews Cuban Pete's I'll keep brief - bottom line, place rocks. That's find insanely long wait time weekends! My advice stay near hostess desk wait - might find getting seated earlier expected (has happened probably 4/5 times I've eaten here). Definitely bring wine sangria (white red works) rum mojitos. They upbeat, party atmosphere always loud here. Not good first date deep conversation. Perfect celebrations, girls night, medium sized groups. I feel like can't go wrong food favorite dishes masitas (omg, literally dream these), rip tips, bacon wrapped dates appetizers, vaca frita lechon asado entrees. I've obviously never Cuba food seems pretty authentic me. Give try week want avoid waiting. Also, owner awesome guy get meet him. One time I eating friends brought huge (free) dish vaca frita kind tomato sauce, said "here go, good try kinds Cuban food!" left us. He helps get people seated faster wait crazy too, really nice. 5.0 My boyfriend I LOVE food Cuban Pete's. We've gone twice far. The ambiance fabulous much fun. Not decorated like Cuba, live band members walking sporadically playing authentic music! Both times I got ropa vieja white rice beans, sweet plantains. It's also great bring boos, do. The food DELICIOUS. My boyfriend Cuban me! I highly recommend! Side note: There always hour-long wait, put name THEN look parking (which hard find). The first time waited *one* minute owner gave us 6 couples $50 gift certificates! It nice him! He awesome. 5.0 I'm sure already heard place crazy wait times table unfortunately rumors true. If tough wait time, light end tunnel best pound pound, dollar dollar cuban food area! I always reccommend starting meal masitas: crispy, meaty, fatty pieces pork; make sure squeeze lime juice them. For entree can't go wrong lechon asado; roast pork plenty garlic vaca frita: braised beef fried onions peppers (again squeeze lime one!!). The accompanying rice, black beans, plaintains real deal too...good luck staying low carb here. Wash beverage choice bring home liquor store next door. They'll make pitchers sangria wine pitchers mojitos rum. Service hit miss generally pretty good insanely packed unorganized dining area seems, like said time stick wait table; enjoy experice here. 4.0 Cuban Pete's restaurant mostly ambiance. Some may say almost like feel really Cuba. I believe wonderful job bringing forth feel. The waiters wear matching Guayabera's straw hats. The food bit good great. I Cuban I much better Cuban food BUT dishes definitely worth trying. Their churrasco amazing(my favorite dish here), papa rellenas good, ropa vieja okay. I crazy roast pork croquetas meh... small. Other I tried chicken seafood dishes, I go back. It BYOB. You bring alcohol mojitos wine sangria mixes have. Which way sangria mixes nice, I enjoy it.  Whenever someone's birthday, waiters get together bongos & guayos start sing happy birthday, fun entertaining. I must point though, go weekend prepared wait least hour longer seated. 3.0 The place ill eat Bloomfield ave Montclair.  Cant get enough place.  I've many times time I stick crispy beef good I dont want miss havin I go.  The sangria top notch flavorful.  It byob plan drinking eating get liqour store way.  The staff polite go busy time establishment doea get loud.  I would comment desserts offered im always full try whenever I go.  If desserts anything like rest food ordered they'll taste great too. 4.0 Cuban Pete's favorite restaurant Montclair, place packed great places eat. There several reasons Cuban Pete's cut rest, however: ambiance, food, service 100%, every time I've been. My gripe inside volume music much loud, place perfect. I would recommend sitting outside since summer, get table without waiting hour. The wait worth it, however, eating outside makes experience much better. The wall waterfalls really cool beautiful waiters always look sharp nice attentive. Their tapas menu excellent always tasty, specifically empanadas, cuban sandwiches, ham coquettes. I tend stick Lechon Asado, garlicy, slow-roasted pork goodness. I've also tried mango chicken excellent. The sangria offerings also tasty, namely Spanish Harlem. I brought bottle Bacardi, waiter kindly mixed perfect juice made guava, pineapple, papaya. It amazing! Good times night. Overall, despite crowds loud music, Cuban Pete's one time favorites incredible Cuban cuisine, amazing service, beautiful ambiance. 5.0 Really excellent food fun atmosphere! It's BYOB, forget, apparently wine beer. We brought handle Captain Morgan's said allowed. But turned blind eye said could hide table. A couple tables around us also hard liquor seem like big deal. So, probably get away too. I've I could see place gets SERIOUSLY packed especially weekends. Apparently, can't make reservations either. We came group 7 8:00 Wednesday night place packed. So, keep mind. The tapas small cheap since 7 us offered family style portions. Chicken empanadas, beef empanadas, chicken lollipops, goat cheese fritters platanos relleno. We ate ALL it. The goat cheese fritters platanos relleno aka plantains stuffed queso really best all. For meal, I got chicken con mangos good! The coconut rice serve SO good. Everyone else table got skirt steaks kind. I tried good. Also, one person got pulled pork tasted better looked. Not dry all, lots garlic flavors. As far service goes, little meh. I understand place busy. The servers legitimately running around place working hard though. Also, went really hot day, I think 94 degrees day arrived 8 night barely cooled down. We sweating profusely sitting dinner. There air conditioner room totally sucked. Other that, great place be. I recommend everyone try house hot sauce here. It's spicy flavorful. 4.0 Food always amazing. It makes long wait. A group 7 us went last night (Thursday) birthday awesome time. Had handsome Greg server.
