 Drinks bad, hot chocolate watered latte burnt taste it. The food also poor quality, service worst part, cashier rude. 1.0 This worst experience I've ever casual coffee/light fare place.  The server disappeared 20 minutes, talking friend window girlfriend I sat dumbfounded dude nerve job.  We're trying make eye contact, clearly getting paid talk bud important him. My girlfriend went counter server disappeared back another 5 minutes (what guy doing?) asked order food something.  The girl counter gives weird look says "I'll get server."  When arrive back, look table laugh.  Yeah, leaving us hanging half-a-goddamn hour place two customers funny - retrospect, collective incompetence false sense entitlement certainly was. The food okay.  For place called "toast," I'd figured bread would better, cold Le Bus.  Additionally, I'm 95% sure "andouille" special link pre-packaged offering Trader Joe's cut four pieces.  $9 unapologetic mediocrity happening again. Avoid place like plague.  I almost leave tip, honestly I have.  I felt buyer's remorse day.  What disgrace. 1.0 This located site old Spruce St. Video.  The mild cofee good pastris great.  At times, service slow even busy times patrons receive complimentary mimosa drink.  The WIFI good. 3.0 I enjoyed coffee breakfast twice Toast recent visit Philly. The first morning I enjoyed Omelette du Jour savory filling roast tomato, portobello, artichoke, goat cheese, wilted spinach. It accompanied crisp small side salad baby greens, tomato, berries. The house dressing light complementary, powering. I HAD complement chef. The barista recommended pour coffee disappoint. He prepared cup care attention time form. I followed pour wonderful latte, prepared well. As I leaving town, I decided visit breakfast long trip ahead. This breakfast delicious Eggs Benedict combo perfectly done complemented mushrooms, roast tomato, generous helping wilted greens. A rich cup melted butter accompanied dish sweet side salad brought balance meal. This time barista made perfect cup French Pressed Guatemalan Vienna roast coffee. It balanced bright, yet rich flavor. I second cup go! Cudos barista, chef, friendly staff. Toast definitely place visit, eat, enjoy coffee prepared variety ways. Don't miss one! 5.0 I love Toast! The food choices fantastic - I love serve brunch day, coffee well brewed prepared. I'm fan large windows - perfect location sit people watch little while. Nestled Center City, Toast provides people like travel city work little de-stress kick back little bit. The staff wonderfully friendly always eager provide suggestions sure get.  Now school starting back also makes perfect environment settle studying. I love fact play Maps Yeah Yeah Yeah's - related Pandora stations - really sets mood unwind casual conversation friends. Can't wait go back! 5.0 The egg English muffin (their take eggs Benedict) fantastic. Service quick pleasant. They multiple roasters providing coffee barista knew make good cup. They La Marzocco Strada espresso choose Chemex, French Press, Fetco filter coffee. There plenty seating, well lot, comfortable. Free wifi available. Good stuff. 5.0 wonderful relaxed vibe fantastic homemade English muffins. best Earl Grey tea Center City.....looking forward outdoor seating Spring. friendly helpful staff delight! 5.0 Extremely slow kitchen. I went hour eat shift told server information well. I got canned fruit omelette 45 minutes later. I boxed left. About 2 weeks later I waiting quick hem asked fastest thing could make, bagel cream cheese answer. That took 15 minutes. Don't come time constraints. 1.0 I really wanted love toast. It's quaint cozy, perfect place hop call layover Philadelphia. I figured I'd get latte food there. The latte upwards $4 small. I also ordered turkey sausage grilled cheese, I believe around $10. We sat availed free wifi (great perk) waiting food, came within 15 mins. I took bite crunchy grilled cheese, basically size wonder bread slice, immediately horrified. This grilled cheese turkey sausage; fucking abomination. I spread sandwich ONE slice cheese it--it dry even gooey sticky. Also, ONE turkey sausage link sliced half spread diagonally across sandwich. I would say approximately 70% sandwich turkey-less. The server happened nearby boyfriend said something grilled cheese cheese...and happily took back made new one, cheese amount turkey sausage. It nice gesture honestly, highway robbery serve sandwich charge $10 it. At sandwich costs $2 make...and I'm including side salad greens. Overall, toast needs step game. A little less stingy cheese, Some small tweaks menu, slightly reasonable prices, place would great. 2.0 First brunch experience Philly (actually entire life), oh man, I see brunch thing. My friends I initially planned Green Eggs Café, would wait 45 minutes table, came instead. Not waitress seat us quickly, place also provided toasty ambience. (No pun intended.) I ordered plate special egg toast: two poached eggs served atop homemade split English muffin, smoked salmon asaparagus side. (I opted Hollandaise sauce.) O-M-G. While I get runny yolk porn experience, bite delicious sensation salty savory. Also, English muffin point - chewy carb-y. I definitely recommend place nice brunch minus terribly long line. 4.0 Coffee great I live close convenient! I've handful times eaten twice. Their homemade English muffins delish! I mine jam. I've also avocado toast. It's poached eggs homemade bread alfalfa sprouts plenty avocado side. It comes side salad well. It's really good heavy alfalfa sprouts, I took fine that! Their setup nice, windows, plenty seating even handful plugs want work, I appreciate. Their service leaves something desired though. Weekdays counter service, understandable people work coffee probably want bothered still, attention would nice. I find utensils etc girl counter completely forgot I one waiting food, minutes. I'm good customer service little disappointing I still go coffee pastries. For neighborhood tons coffee shops one pretty good! 3.0 My family I found hidden gem looking place park get breakfast traveling day. We loved everything! The space cute. The food amazing!

The staff friendly, tea good. The omelette tasty. Not sure lack technique cooking lack seasoning spinach tasted really bad. Food: 2/5 Service: 4/5 Location; 4/5 - Super cure place. Nice chill 2.0 The coffee better hear options area, I actually walk way get iced lattes here. The food pretty darn tasty too. 5.0 Toast good breakfast want something hearty filling. There egg toast (pretty much eggs Benedict) good many different forms. I egg toast avocado wife one salmon. I'm huge fish guy said good. 5.0 Great Location, Love vibe, food love service, highly recommended!!! 5.0 Toast comfortable artistic environment good food affordable prices. You spend $5 home made English muffin coffee go larger plate $15. My chia tea brewed site instead mix (hooray!) exceptionally creamy. My truffled egg sandwich right portion fresh salad side strawberries. They huge windows flood space light. The decor cosy meets sculptural mismatched pillows modern artistic lighting. Our check came delightfully attached giant clothespin. It early I went, crowd, staff friendly, fast. 4.0 I stopped Toast way work use pc  and decided try  the eggs benedict  as hungry time kill....What surprise !This far best EB"'s  I've city far. They use real baked  ham wonderful salad rather usual home fries side..  Ive back many times since disappointed yet.  A+ ps -  english muffins home made boot! 5.0 Toast ok. My goat cheese, tomato spinach omelet actually pretty good coffee pretty good too. I hummus plate hummus pretty good. But kind expensive although pretty good great. Which whole thing. It's fine. There's nothing wrong exciting way. I kind pissed make kid plain omelette though clearly capable so. Weird. Nice space. 2.0 Really see vegan items menu. Soy milk even listed option board. I got decent soy cappuccino I better. I need go again. 2.0 The Toast town! 5.0 NOISE! Good food, OK coffee, moderate price much noisy terrible heating/AC system enjoy peaceful meal. 2.0 Fantastic time Toast! The omelet day spinach, goat cheese Capri tomatoes--Yum! Spritzers fab perfect quencher warm day. I also bowl fresh fruit unlike cafés fruit FRESH! It fridge dying icy death perfect strawberries, blueberries, blackberries banana. My kids (3 x 13y + 1(24y) 1 gal pal (13y)) ate everything plates want return. Above service wonderful! 5.0 I would give toast 3.5 stars, option, I'll round 4.  The food pretty good, although basic. Their menu tons options. The place fills quickly weekends, come weekday afternoon study get work done.  I felt french toast tasted kind plain scrambled eggs menu (at brunch place?!?), perhaps changed since last time I went there.  I highly recommend spritzers. They yummy refreshing hot day. 4.0 Solid little tea selection here, plus carry sip n' glo juices (they expensive, good)!  The hours convenient, (Monday Friday 7-7 Saturday/Sunday 8-6).  The hummus wrap looked delightful, sadly, I hungry enough I stopped in.  I definitely back try update accordingly! 4.0 Toast potential amazing - food excellent coffee, service lacking. Came two friends brunch Sunday. We seated immediately though host friendly, rude either. I'm hostess though could've done A LOT better. Anyway, friends ordered lattes I ordered double shot espresso. It took 20 minutes receive coffee..For food, sure, 20 minutes fast, receive drinks?! Did I miss something? It even crowded, I idea took long. If crowded, I'd understand little more. When get food drinks, everything good, complaints there! Friendlier wait-staff better service would make place 5-stars. Toast cute great food, rush go! 4.0 AWFUL! Had half hour kill a.m. bypassed Capogiro go read good things it. What mistake!! First girl working counter barely acknowledged me. When -made eye contact, made wait phone. When finally waited whispered impossible hear god awful fan racket coming kitchen. I waited almost 10 mins get capp - I ONLY one waiting.  When finally get hot. The fan noise kitchen deafening whole place reeked old sandwiches curry, I think. Couldn't leave fast enough. SO relaxing cup coffee hoping for. When I left clothes smelled curry something. It awful. Angry going way unpleasant experience. Only good thing croissant (which sure came elsewhere). 1.0 Finally got try Toast passing many times. It didnt quite live expectations hence 4 star rating, still nice! Came brunch around noon place almost full. The ambience great - clean yet rustic feel white floors/metallic light fixtures contrasting wooden tables/chairs. We got hot chocolate blue lady black tea. The cups quite big, hot choc delicious overly chocolatey fruity refreshing. We got "egg toasts" - avocado truffled mushroom. I agree another yelper avocado could fresher dishes could used little flavor (garlic, salt, onions etc) - adding little hot sauce helped. My boyfriend's poached egg turned fully cooked egg dissapointing waited awhile order (5-10 minutes get drink order another 20 food). But salad surprisingly good - lightly dressed good balance veggies fruits. Our server friendly apologized wait times. Overall - service bit slow food bit bland (for personal taste) staff friendly ambience great. Probably come back drink sometime instead!! 4.0 I love place coffeeshop feel without coffee shop. It's great place study high ceilings giant windows feels spacious without much square footage. Their internet fast little bar us like occasionally stand study. While service little slow, ridiculous baristas friendly. I negative experience yet. The food delicious. They omelettes toast related things, soups along coffees teas I literally day long busy never leave. I'm fan veggie chili occasional wrap, still try menu. 5.0 I think one cutest coffee shops ever.  Visiting night staying across street twice already.  I NY, comments, nothing expensive compared.  Would definitely stop by. 5.0 I've come couple times I love place. Coffee good, service quick food good. I got lox Benedict delicious. Cute little place go weekends. We also much wait coming Sunday kind unheard Philly. I definitely come back! 5.0 On Sunday, I ordered soy caramel latte. They caramel, vanilla, I settled mocha paid. The employees realized soy milk. It happens, way handled it... They completely unphased unapologetic. Just refund "k cya". I'm convinced customer service dead city recent experience Toast reaffirmed that. 1.0 Toast, killing me. I've tried many times like place since I live close it, one disappointment another. The prices oddly absurd. I got small coffee tiny muffin (about 1-2 inches diameter) came almost $6! Not mention muffin absolutely flavor kind stale. I hate feel regret making purchase happened times Toast now. They get business convenience weather gross go somewhere farther. 1.0 Excellent breakfast spot, good coffee, course, wonderful toast! 4.0 Toast shockingly good breakfast place.  Their sandwich board outside always seems advertising tea desserts, breakfast brunch really at. On low end, restaurant-quality egg sandwiches food truck prices. The rest menu quite small, I think designed sort restaurant-managing genius, every item I've tried basically best I've ever eaten. Wilted greens egg toast?  The plate beautifully deliciously covered greens mushrooms, homemade muffins crispy perfect, hollandaise excellent.  Hummus plate?  I expect much, actually amazing -- highlight salted bagel chips, somehow crunchy chewy.  And I've never better yogurt parfait anywhere: chewy honey granola perfect, use plain Pequea Valley yogurt already favorite, thing loaded berries. 5.0 WTF SURLY BARISTA?  When I stumble 7am, I expect least smile.  When I ask green tea, ass sigh say "only like FIVE" give advice.  I know shit green tea! Also, red eye last time stunk. BOOOO HISS. 2.0 really awesome neighborhood cafe. staff friendly helpful. waiter put best corner spot work hours. coffee food pretty decent prices. incorporating spot brunch cycle. really love soundtrack too--belle & sebastian, modest mouse, lots shins. 4.0 Overall, good cappuccino.  Strong coffee flavor, smoky aftertaste.  I normally prefer creamy consistency, sour tinge end, I much mind taste Toast's cappuccino.  Verging $4 territory, pricey drink.  Although I sample, fold menu looked intriguing.  Also, went cold day seating area opposite toasty.  Worth visit though. 4.0 Came brunch good. Friendly staff, food arrived timely manner. I love Toast supports local art community featuring work local artists. 4.0 Just moved neighborhood I'm happy little cafe block away. The barista friendly, atmosphere quiet relaxing inviting. The kitchen closed tonight I'll hold fifth star till I try food, definitely spot visit. My cappuccino delicious artfully made. 4.0 Wonderful. Just wonderful. I walk, cycle, train long distances well made cappuccino cozy place sit work. When offer sort whole grain option quick breakfast (bagels, oatmeal), better. When staff polite sweet courteous skilled---I fall love. Seriously happy Toast. I'll enjoy coming weekday mornings write (it's quiet time!). And short 2-block walk 12th/Locust PATCO speedline station (I live Collingswood). Expertly crafted soymilk cappuccino pumpernickel bagel $5.50, plus $1.00 tip (baristas deserve tips, too!). 5.0 Nice vibes, ok food warm service. Good prices much food it. 3.0 I. Love. Toast. My favorite Café study in...also favorite green tea eggs benny toast. 5.0 I've once. The coffee fine. The hot line nice change Philly cafes, I like basic egg sandwich---it quite dry. Service slow, one barista working. (At 9am weekday... ouch! I envy him.) 2.0 Great atmosphere great coffee! 4.0 place upon walking smelled like pan burnt bacon. overpowering. exhaust? staff welcoming seemed though couch area break room. eating, hanging out. even mop bucket stored open customers could sit next eat by, couch taken employees is. cup coffee good. hours later garments still smell like 4 day old burnt cast iron skillet. blah. 1.0 Great food drinks. Fresh salads sandwiches quality ingredients. Good service atmosphere. Sometimes wait small. 3.0 Great expensive coffee. Their large 16oz $3. Not much variety to-go food. When walk in, know whether seat hostess seat you. This awkward want waiter service coming quick bite catch work. English muffins amazing along homemade jam. 3.0 Toast expanded  menu offerings since original review. The daily specials they've added make interesting options. I also like food generally healthy, right sized portions fair prices go them. They've able make small kitchen space, earning another star me. 5.0 This really nice place get hot chocolate near 12th spruce. It's fast convenient affordable. I come lot since brother apartment close it, next building it. So far I've tried hot chocolate nine times ten I would get instead coffee, I've seen food menu tried anything yet tried small macaroon good airy tasty. 5.0 Came breakfast people service lacking! Took anyone acknowledge us. Once seated, waited long I got grabbed menus table. The waitress/host nice enough, busy. Homemade English muffins dry!!! I ordered breakfast sandwich egg, cheese, bacon. Bacon good, whole sandwich dry. My friend received wrong order said could re-do it, would take 15 minutes. We already waited long enough 4 breakfast sandwiches. Coffee tea good. Relaxed ambiance nice. I would return unless lot time waste like dry sandwiches. 2.0 I'm giving guys 4 stars, really 3.5.  Ate brunch boyfriend yesterday overall super happy everything, although blips could work full 5-star material.  First, I served delicious hot coffee cute mug - milk sugar even spoon.  I carefully carry hot mug milk/sugar station across room (it small room, that's good), hunt clean spoon since none available station.  If serving sit-down brunch, patrons able remain sitting prepping coffee. The food also really good, also consistently awesome across board.  My boyfriend smoked salmon poached eggs hollandaise homemade English muffins.  It amazing 0 hollandaise right amount lemony thin feel refreshing, gloopy fatty.  His English muffin also tender delicious. My dish, hand, hard English muffin, slices less-than-good avocado perched atop sprouts topped poached eggs side roasted tomatoes.  The tomatoes bomb eggs sprouts fine, avocado sucked.  They even black strings - that's good avocado. This whole dish would 10 times delicious pesto, hopefully read add :) It seems like staff new there's definitely potential improve little inconsistencies Toast.  I'll definitely go back next time I'm Philly. 4.0 Toast really nice relaxed ambiance.  I stopped go friend impressed. They nice variety teas coffee.  I tried chai tea latte, delicious.  My friend tried one exciting tea blends, loved it.  We also bagels, little pricey, great on-the-go breakfast.  I'd love come back sit-down experience I loved space lots windows, comfortable-looking seats pillows, open space. 4.0 I found walking Toast I area photo shoot.  It cold day corner coffee joint I needed.  I liked vibe soon I walked in.  It good look, bustling people drinking coffee eating.  The staff friendly menu offered I looking for.   While I waited coffee made, I grabbed seat little sofa.  A great spot relax, people watch consume caffeine.  The prices totally fair, nothing crazy.  My drink good served added touch Barista art.  I'd visit I find area again. 3.0 Not big breakfast person place changed mind. Wasn't pleased coffee poached eggs smoked salmon decided breakfast new favorite meal dessert. Hollandaise sauce? Perfection. Greens fruits? Fresh succulent. I never give son juice added sugar, Toast, fresh squeeze ripe orange juice is.  The reason get 5 latte tasted watered service bit snotty. But barring that, Toast brunch occasion... I wonder take out... 4.0 I absolutely love Toast.  I live ton coffee shops/brunch places Toast favorite.  Very friendly staff, best cup coffee area, incredible bacon, egg, cheese croissants.  A little pricey side, get pay for. 5.0 I sooo pleased Toast neighborhood.  After space went empty restaurant coffeeshop/restaurant coffeeshop, time solid cafe took root.  The decor simple airy, given large glass windows facing 12th Spruce Streets.  I love sitting cushioned window seats lounging pillows I pretend work really people watch.  The space ideal study, brunch friends grab-and-go coffee. The coffee quite tasty offer multiple varieties.  They seasonal drinks offer juices smoothies.  Yum!  Have coffee juice breakfast complete.  But want something substantial, choose croissants, bagels, brownies salads sandwiches.  I personally like hummus wrap full nutrients fresh flavors.  Good morning evening work sessions. Lastly, I comment owners staff friendly accommodating.  I always pleasant chats baristas, recent visit noticed cup holding everyone's loyalty cards (so remember bring you)!  Best neighborhood coffee spot! 4.0 This place different taste breakfast brunch, I'm fan. You find basics: eggs way, pancakes... know I mean. BUT! find fresh perspective fresh ambience, fresh service, fresh food, fresh view street corner seat house. The quirky highlight - toast theme. Toast takes eggs benedict different level. It's dish smothered hollandaise. Instead, seven varieties called "egg toasts," $10.50 less. Still poached eggs sitting top english muffin (they're fresh baked premise), toppings vary. We ordered "warm apples" egg toast came baked apple, sausage, white cheddar. Delicious, appropriate "responsible" portion (read: big feel like junk after), served side salad. Perfect size E-money. I egg sandwich. Starts $2.50 pay extra things like tomato, avocado, cheese, bacon/sausage, etc. Bacon ($1.75), avocado ($2), smoked gouda ($1) choices delicious english muffin (couldn't tell cheeses available - smoked gouda first heard stopped server there). Other "toast" choices include white, wheat, baguette, bagel, croissant. The sandwich disappoint. Cheese melted, let taste smoked gouda really come through. Egg fried. Add ketchup Tapatio hot sauce can't go wrong. Our side turkey sausage a-ok, nothing get excited about. Curious whether make sausage bring in. Coffee drinkers expect good cup joe - E-money super picky coffee gave Toast's warm cup ringing endorsement. If prefer tea, like me, pleased variety. I ginger mint! Really enjoyed breakfast Toast. Showed little 10am  on Saturday wait, tough thing come days brunch craze. I bought dark chocolate, sea salt brownie I paid bill counter - looks awesome. Expect see back Toast hurry - probably follow suit. 4.0 Super convenient considering I live top coffee shop! I love coffee free mimosa weekends brunch. You heard free mimosa!!! It get better hearty healthy breakfast mimosa. This place still new I would assume brunch menu continually evolve become much expansive time. Right get traditional brunch stuff like eggs bacon omelates interesting menu! Did I mention free mimosa? I also like vibe place goes back coffee shop roots, I student I would definitely hang toast study consume coffee! 4.0 Very cute coffee shop. Quick nice service. A group us head afternoon fun. Since Mother Nature angry giving us heat waves, ordered iced drinks. All tasty caffeine trick. 3.0 Super-cute, comfy, everyone nothing friendly helpful.   The reason missing star things bit expensive side here. I probably stop coffee go... planning camping use wifi read, makes sense invest nice comfortable setting. 4.0 Great decor vibe. Secured wifi. Excellent freshly-queezed OJ. Fantastic eggs Benedict lox asparagus. Service could friendlier. But overall still excellent option brunch lunch. Too bad air ventilation poor: every time went (i.e. dozens) 45 minutes café, eyes would start itching. And 60 mins would leave, point would smelling like cooked kitchen couple hours. So reason, we've stopped going. Too bad. 4.0 Excellent coffee nice sandwiches. Really good quick breakfast relaxing cup coffee.The bagels really decent I'm New Yorker! 4.0 Great idea, great menu, awful food. My sandwich undercooked eggs...and hair :( 1.0 I rate coffee since company roasts brew right, really know pull great shot espresso! The food exemplary, service always smile. Great shop, always stop I neighborhood. 5.0 YOLO, I'm kind glad live once, I hope successor also follow namesake, Toast, I like you, I want toast. PROS For studying spot gets 5 stars: quiet, (aside pleasant background music), usually study spots near outlets, abundance pillows comfort, reliable wifi, high ceilings, good people watching zone out, last least... never anyone (although bode well future place, I selfishly love emptiness). They take credit cards I found food reasonably priced (although I can't vouch quality). They actually extensive menu salads eggs benedict (around $10) well cheaper toast/bagel options. The one barrista super sweet, first time I came working, friendly I stop figure I knew actually best friend I'd forgotten I had, super awesome. It latter. She also took pity us brought us water we'd miserably staring screens/books hours. CONS Drinks bit overpriced (2.75 tea?) huge selection teas. The AC spotty last week, they've resolved issue I think. Highly recommend study spot, place weekday/all day quiet breakfast/brunch/snack/solo dining. So let's raise toast Toast, hope one sticks. 4.0 Stumbled upon great cafe looking brunch one day. Great "egg toasts" - version eggs benedict, variety ways. Excellent coffee espresso beverages, everyone really friendly! 5.0 Went around noon Sunday Memorial Day weekend, 2013.  Sat outside. Ordered something amounted eggs benedict mushrooms, side turkey sausage, french pressed coffee.   Service good -  attentive friendly.   Coffee came first.  Under brewed.  Brown color.  Poached eggs undercooked, barely.  Eggs atop seemed like english muffin, toasted, chewy :-P   Turkey sausage, silver dollar form, tasted funny.  Everything tepid, except iced water. I mention anything service.  I think asked. It's nice space, coffee options great.  I hope get better execution food drink. 2.0 Decor nice, food coffee decent. It's good enough justify prices, though. 3.0 This place new, quaint. The coffee superb, well-made. Each cup make grind french press. Don't go full, food equally good.. I got poached eggs toast (YUM). This location near everything, short walk Midtown Village Gayborhood shopping after. Very cool vibe here, quick, friendly service. This place deserves attention. 4.0 I absolutely enthusiastic cute coffee shop finally opening space! The space decent, loud overrun like coffee shops area, staff extremely nice helpful! I giving three stars, however, definitely room improvement. I understand opened still working identity, I think could little meals coffee. I huge tea drinker unimpressed tea list. A good sweet non-caffeine tea usually favorite, fall short. They could use fun flavors like ginger, lemon, vanilla rooibos, etc. I also expand "snack" section too. I sure something want do, however, want weekday coffee shop, offering little snacks like fruit, granola bars, nuts, perhaps even health smoothies could really go long way student want full meal, little something hold over. All said, breakfasts absolutely amazing coffee espresso selections great. What do, well, could benefit little growth. 3.0 Finally cafe spot I like. Ever since Oddfellows closed down, I set foot place. (For reason I bring frequent restaurant called YOLO) I tried food yet, I coffee study, ambience friendly, iced coffee tasty, server's British accent quite charming. See soon, Toast! 4.0 It's common give 5-star review Toast earned it.   They earn easy 3 stars food coffee.  It tastes great, eggs bacon done perfectly order.  I feel like prices low enough I feel guilty stopping times week. The fourth star earned unfussy cute cafe seating area free wifi.  They mind hanging hours weekday get work done enjoying coffee egg sandwich.  Way better food ambiance chain coffee shops - great place casual morning business meeting. We've visit Sunday brunch too.  They extra people there's never wait. The fifth star due wonderful customer service.  The two girls I see almost time welcoming friendly.  After first visits, recognize know I'm going order.   I definitely keep coming back Toast, I hope fares better YOLO Odd Fellows. 5.0 Toast cute place cute name! I'm happy coffee shop block reopened...and reopened better (formerly known YOLO formerly known Odd Fellows)! Everyone works Toast friendly I love bright atmosphere. Their coffee strong amazing. I'm big fan Americanos lattes. 5.0 I really like place lot! Came brunch friends town. Green Eggs packed Valanni wasnt open yet...little know great time would Toast! The staff great efficient. Even werent sure would staying eat, happily sat us drink orders. We ended deciding stay happy lattes meals. I got poached eggs vegetarian chili avocado---yummmm. I loved fresh side salad came with. The downer would $3 substitute charge "large" portion side potatoes friend didnt want side salad. But that, great experience. Nice ambiance great people watching. Even though smaller place, didnt try rush us table. Much appreciated! 4.0 Paid $7 bagel lox go. I got one tiny sliver lox. And took 15 minutes. What complete joke. 2.0 The cafe pretty cute. It mix chairs comfy booth seats fancy pillows dress up. The staff also friendly. When looking menu outside, prices coffee seemed little high, boyfriend I decided check anyway. We ordered drip coffee cost less expected, I think must looking price french pressed coffee one fancy variations....The coffee bit weak, maybe I'm fan dark roasts, light one. I'm definitely willing give second chance maybe try food next time I saw guests chowing tasty-looking breakfast. 3.0 Was quite excited new place, say rather disappointed.  The service lacklustre, like everything bit much trouble.  And sadly food, beautifully presented, live promise.  The place selling "toast", really serving perfectly toasted English muffins.  Ours soft enough middle toasted.  Coffee fine nothing write home about. Overall, nothing offensive place.  It underwhelming enough bother going back, city packed great brunch places. 3.0 FInally place I relax enjoy atmosphere without costing fortune. It clean cozy. Staff personable. Great place lazy day informal date. 4.0 I'm relatively new PHL, however place changed name +/- management 3-4 times far. One would imagine abysmal business would learn attempts reinvent itself. This new edition, Toast, clearly well again, judging persistent lack clientele. The day I walked in, hardly anything done decor. It remains bland unoriginal, despite prime geo location. A mere Earl Grey cost CC café astonishing dollar! My surprise meant I discussed issue partner wondered management place thinking. Today, I decided go place again, give another assessment. Like before, mere couple customers bored looking barista. The toll, $2.95 16 oz coffee! Extortionate worst transaction AMEX long time. When consider good coffee somewhere else Center City around $1.75 realise absurd Toast is. Justification? Coffee beans grown extraterrestrial soil fertilised manure produced last unicorn? Won't returning here. 1.0 I love cafe. It's fantastic place study. There's wi-fi outlets. Decent coffee tea. I enjoy chai, creamy slightly sweet. Great comfortable environment. I love eggs benedict, I can't wait try food one day. I love love LOVE place! 5.0 I three times breakfast & love it.  The poached eggs sausage, cheddar cheese & dijonnaise great!  Only downside gets hot sunny & shades keep sun eyes. 4.0 This place opened street me, I excited finally something otherwise vacant storefront month ago. Toast nice place stop speciality coffee, latte, espresso really know they're there. However, comes ordering food breakfast sandwiches egg toasts, they're pretty slow. So prepared wait. However, lazy Saturday Sunday time kill, seat one pillowed booths enjoy. 3.0 First Odd Fellows memorable quality name. Then YOLO (You Only Live Once) bad tasteless name. Now simply Toast. This time someone got right. That someone V., owns Chhaya East Passyunk  avenue. V brings high qualityingredients superb cooking  to Center City. With distinctly uncomplicated flare choose sandwiches, salads, pastries list sides. You mix match stick classic "bacon , egg cheese" and, voila, done. There's fussiness Center City dining gets nerves. I hate server can't pronounce menu items foreign word phrase used English would suffice. Toast chucks fussiness breakfast lunch fare. This streamlined method I want I still slightly drunk night stomach "carb-cheese-MEAT" mode. Great  morning midday meals, toast win Center City. 4.0 Replacing YOLO Cafe, Toast eclectic blend loose leaf teas & coffee, delicious "egg toasts" (poached eggs top homemade english muffins), sandwiches homemade goodies. *Try egg toast warm apples, white cheddar cheese, sausage dijonnaise! AMAZING. I'm impressed revamping place, interior cozy, clean perfect brunch friends studying Thursday afternoon. The baristas helpful, friendly warm. I coming weekly basis. Cheers Toast! 5.0 Great atmosphere, clean awesome coffee! We needed place like neighborhood! :) 4.0 There good news bad news. The good news, make good cup coffee. Now bad. I looking place stop cup coffee. First, I passed right place. It looked like regular restaurant me, isn't, coffee shop. I confused coffee shop called "toast".  As really sell anything toasted. It looks like typo, I think meant call "roast". As would made sense. The places looks great, selling Caribbean food. It looks light tropical looking  with floor ceiling windows. The menu confusing. You need wine expert understand "hint" favor note. Meaning, favored coffee. They drawings french press another one I really know was. I guess ask? On counter laminated papers moving around place real menu. All confusing place. 2.0 well picture mimi m."pigging " enough ruin appetite food  . tastes like R&L  frozen crap , change things aware lot people notice ...the pizza ok used better ,  . pizza thing edible.    mimi please pics eating  ! 1.0 racist rock bar typical bayonne bar 1.0 This place truly terrible ....as boy growing I enjoyed food specially buffalo wings food nasty.....maybe hired different cook something need invest new cook something .....food nowhere near good use be. 1.0 HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!! I tried taking teenage daughter last summer celebrate winning cheerleading competetion. We immediatly seated & told server would right us.We waited almost 10min. & (I assume) manager asked ok. I told dying thirst! She asked us would like walked server & told get us. The server walked towards us & distracted friends bar. We waited another 5 min. I frustrated (&hungry) wait anymore. We got & started walk manager (I assume) rushed tell us drinks would right out. I told thank & never returning! 1.0 pizza alright food pretty tough . 2.0 Try thin pizza, best around! 4.0 I love thin pizza thier grilled chicken salad - mention french onion soup.  A really fun place, fresh food, great entertainment. 4.0 Just moved area Florida great find. Sports lounge, pool table, free WiFi, great bartender( Stacy ) short walk away home Great!!! 4.0 This place one favorite bars New Jersey go drink. They always good beer selection bartenders cool seen times take care you. It's great place watch sporting events type, got really nice outdoor tiki lounge chill summer. The clientele definitely colorful that's makes fun. And unlike chill bars I've to, food really great, especially pizza wings. Big thumbs up! I've spent many fun night here. 4.0 The bar side great tvs everywhere, outsides nice feature, food amazing Specially 3 drinks, bar bayonne. Convenient, nice pool table good time friends. Also servers par, u go ask chris. He"s upcoming comedian.  Also ask kim hotttt. And course drink never empty, would u want sports bar.

Delicious Thin Pizza! Love spot pig out! 5.0 This 2 1/2 star review. The sad thing is, I go pretty frequently I walk here. If want drink Yuenglings Bud light watch baseball, hockey football, go here. They lot TVs projection screen usually catch Yankees Devils. I care football, I assume watch Giants here. I think people actually like Jets. If want go bar hang act like civilized human being, eat something sustenance, hang Old Man Budweiser Crowd Bayonne Police Department go somewhere else. Lot 13 cool. Venice cool. The food edible, except pizza. But Bayonne land pizza other, better options. I love bar. But closest place apartment. 2.0 I went grab something eat. Mind you, I reviewing bar area since I hang there. I reviewing dinning side. You walk in, see green everywhere: chairs, rug (that looks quite dirty) wallpaper. With said, ambience pretty horrible. I noticed everyone walking could qualify medicare -- within age group, maybe like place. 20-30s, go somewhere else. We sit point, I praying food good. We ordered wings ok, nothing special. My husband ordered pizza good (I would actually consider ordering delivery). I got antipasto salad. It ok. Also menu extensive, pretty regular american cuisine menu. Seems like people go thin crust pizza. The service good, waitress forgot salad, tried play quite obvious. Never got refill drink. Needless say good experience overall. Maybe put dollars fixing place would worth something. As currently stands I would stay away it. 1.0 This place used one favorite sports bars, extent still is. I used come time, great place sit watch sports , got good projectors , giants screens big games good tenders. The bar par absolutely amazing, although recently seems like something different isnt good. But even good normally , still great bar pie.  Thin crusted well done bit crispness. Yumm! That quality night kinda hit miss depending crowd.  Its seems like last years lot older sit corner get nearly pass drunk types. The types either get alittle chatty friendly try hit anything movies yelling it. (Think typical shore guido would 40 years now) But get good crowd still great time people arent getting belligerent . It gets pretty crowded football games come early grab good spot. It makes nice Sunday ,  its Thursday/Friday night sports event going crowd gets weird.  Come weekend Friday night set good time night hit miss. PS huge parking lot around back easy parking. 3.0 Pizza use pretty good quality gone hell.  If decide order delivered make sure advance seems always take hour get food even delivered 15 block away. So expect food stone cold....and I mean cold.  Think eating food sitting table 3 hours eat it.  Very disappointing considering food (albeit bar food)  always lack much quality there. 2.0 This place best thin crust pizza, period. People rave Pete Elda's shore, places around state decent thin crust pizza, THIS real deal. As I understand it, exact pizza recipe used EJ's Bayonne back day. I went EJ's A LOT kid growing Jersey City, confirm really exact stuff. Perfectly cooked thin crust, lots cheese tasty sauce. It's thin crust pizza done right! Don't come fancy decor, prompt professional service, bells whistles. Go PIZZA. This Bayonne, place represents Bayonne pretty accurately, eyes. It's best representation Bayonne thin crust pizza. Go place street want super thin crust. 4.0 worst  pizza I ever had! 1.0 It's good place watch game, beers, apps. There decent menu. I'm fan buffalo blasts Steak Murphy wrap. During warmer months, there's tiki bar. 4.0 I love big apple bar.  It thier thin crusted pizza keeps coming back, best!  if u big appetite order two pies bc crust thin u see it...LOL......i never eaten main course thiere thier appetizers awesome well fried raviolis fried mac cheese bites.....delicious..... basically place good appetizers couple beers course pizza 4.0 Zero stars. This place redeeming qualities whatsoever. Terrible food clientele straight The Hills Have Eyes. 1.0 I like support local businesses I kept seeing commercials Big Apple, I thought would good place go eat. This place divided two areas. The bar, looks nice sporty, dining area, wife I sat. This area looks like old folks home. I say, worst "restaurant" food I ever life. It ran local grocery store, bought frozen food, microwaved gave me. It terrible! The salad chunks lettuce root appealing. I NEVER go back place tell anyone asks place avoid like plague. Is possible give place negative stars? 1.0 VEGETARIANS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!! My boyfriend I regulars State Street location usually satisfied.  They fast, reasonably priced good.  But tonight one worst experiences ever. We ordered usual, vegetable chimichangas everything (meaning rice, black beans, guac pico de gallo) hot sauce sour cream beef chimichangas everything except sour cream hot sauce. Where went wrong... boyfriend eats poultry, beef pork..I eat almost anything except I HATE sour cream like spice hot sauce.  We got 2 containers, one marked "B" unmarked. The one marked "B"  was vegetable unmarked beef hot sauce sour cream. Unfortunately,  for us unmarked one beef hot sauce sour cream boyfriend realize bites meat. He put red meat body 25 yrs, course made sick. Upset, since neither us dinner I called rectify problem.  The person answered spoke little english, trying explain problem issue. I asked anyone spoke english put someone.  This gentleman told thats I ordered kept responding "yeah?" ...So, frustrating minutes offer comp meal, remake right offer us comp next visit, I told lost week customer. WE WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!!! They would've recieved four star reveiw otherwise. 2.0 We went La Carreta lunch closed. So went dinner, fortunately, long trudge, finally sat around table. The restaurant located residential area, quiet peaceful, obscure deep green signboard. It convenient get there, customers (to exact, zero entered). The environment nothing special, comparison Mexican restaurants. There small decorations like picture Mexican man. Not much use bright colors, whole room furniture looked little bit old. There four tables it. I guess possibly provide delivery service. The kitchen main part restaurant, seem used providing table service. We ask silverware, paper napkins. There three four people working restaurant, time cooking food, except one would run customer need. We could see pictures dishes wall, extremely useful foreigners like roommates. The menu piece paper, convenient easy understand. I took one, hoping learn complex names Mexican dishes. Haha... It took 15 minutes dishes served. Not fast, opinion. We 5 people ordered: Chicken Burritos, Beef Burritos. Chicken Quesadillas, Enchiladas Vegetarian Tacos. Burritos American style, one friends commented, tasted good. I found beans, cheese, cabbage chicken fillings, I liked all. Quesadillas soft, strong taste cheese. Another friend felt cheese Mexican - orange color signaled likely cheddar cheese. Enchiladas sweet spicy enough. Vegetarian Tacos full vegetables looked healthy. The flour tortillas served tacos taste extremely fresh. Maybe purchased stored rather made restaurant. We also ordered Mexico-made sodas. Different flavors, different colors, right sweetness, made real sugar, nice change normal soda menus. The price relatively low, portion big. We spent $9 per person, including tips. I managed finish half burritos. In conclusion, though meal authentic expected, tasted bad least worth money paid. The environment service barely satisfactory. 3.0 For price place solid. Cart food restaurant. Cash only. 4.0 best burritos connecticut, love cart yale hockey rink 5.0 This review La Carreta cart Prospect Street Science Hill. I passed food carts years wary trying them. For first one, I chose La Carreta I mood burrito, chicken burrito die for. He warms huge tortilla piles ingredients, tomatoes, cheese, coleslaw/cabbage-kind salad delicious, black beans, rice, chicken, sour cream, such. The burrito fresh far surpasses quality Moe's, local chain Mexican eatery. The huge burrito $4.50 well worth money. 5.0 place flippin amaaaaazing. pork best- tender juicy abundant! menu simple cheap, always prepared perfection. glad close, bc la caretta addiction strooooonnnnng! nom! 5.0 This review cart Med School. I love good taco. Burrito...quesadilla....etcetera. This cart has, far, best tacos I've New Haven! For 6 dollars get rice, beans, three tacos (with toppings/fillings choice), sour cream smoky chipoltle sauce. I crave regular. Stop cart area - disappointed. 4.0 Best tacos New Haven. 5.0 Consistently good fresh actually pretty amazing considering price. The veggie quesadillas awesome--really anything sauteed mushrooms.  The  people working cool patient try pathetic Spanish ordering picking up. Their cart corner Elm Bway great lunch--fast reliable. 5.0 This review specifically cart Cedar St. outside YNHH, standby mine better part decade. Great veggie burritos, great chicken soft tacos, ask politely, lovely woman prepares food make essentially additions substitutions could possibly want. Even catch later afternoon food still fresh good always. 4.0 They food truck serves super mexican food. They've  got seriously great food here. To make even better prices point! 5.0 This perhaps worst Mexican food New Haven. The meat usually chewy prices kinda high. Maybe I compare food trucks Long Wharf c'mon, 3 tacos $7 sort pricey. That's $2.33 taco. Sure provide rice beans tiny portion good. Plus, simplest order usually takes ridiculously long time prepare. Taquerias like place suppose quick painless. But every time I get take-out seems like I caught completely surprise scramble 2,000 miles Mexico cook food. 2.0 I really understand hype food State Street location... It's cool cabbage burritos, that's it. I tried ask chips/guacamole/ chips charged 3$ handful thick crunchy round chips blob "guacamole" definitely bunch sour cream filler it- fresh all. They salsa @ all. The food horrible, wow ingredients seemed pretty cheap. Maybe I'll try cart since seems folks raving about, I think I'll need head back State Street location. 2.0 cabbage! wilted, soggy lettuce here, crunchy cabbage. cheap, huge delicious. get vegan stuffs night see cutting hunks meat next morn. fresh everyone always super nice. 4.0 This place best Mexican New Haven. The veggie tacos flavorful kinda healthy. Great rice beans. And place romantic first date, I like watching Mexican soap opera tv waiting food. 4.0 For cheap mexican, there's nothing better.  Enchiladas mole fantastic.  Great service, poor atmosphere well worth it! More selection carts. 5.0 This review food cart York street near Yale.  For $5, get one HUGE burrito.  It take away hunger, taste, I've better, honest.  Not burrito bad, everything tasted fresh, flavor I expect Mexican cart lacking.  The Mexican trucks along Long Wharf seem much authentic, concern cleanliness. 3.0 Loved value over-stuffed burrito.  It filled even $6!   The quality excellentl!  Ordered basic chicken burrito loaded chicken, black beans (not refreid beans :)) whole grain rice (not white rice :)) cabbage, little cheese bunch stuff.  The tortilla fresh, chewy warm. My complaint I like messy Burrito sour cream guac pico comes squirting bite item much sauce it. The thing fell rice beans.   I sure I could asked side saucey stuff. Next time I ask put extra burrito itself, may able fold darn thing!!! Definitely recommend place!  You disappointed. 4.0 BEST. IN.

As space, ambience, think restaurant want eat hang friends while. I think best quick casual meal take out. 4.0 Love place. Prices reasonably food delicious. Our favorites enchiladas. For $6, including rice, beans, guacamole, sour cream, can't better. Mostly take-out. 5.0 I've using Yelp scout places I moved New Haven  area.  On places reviews spot on...not here. I got enchiladas mole.  They pretty awful.  The mole  totally tasteless, better taste tortillas used.  The chicken acceptably cooked, rice beans lacked flavor.  The place totally empty I got food, eating I see why.  The place lacked soul (and taste) food! 1.0 Really?  I can't believe people give good reviews!  Especially claim form Cali!  I lived CA too.  Their burritos nearly good ones form Tijuana taco cart!  I live across street La Caretta, I gotten take out, including taco salad.  I can't imagine something unhealthier less authentic.  The reviews I understand ones say price amount food ratio good.  Their burritos ARE cheaper Tijuana's.  The people I know eat frugal male scientists need maximize caloric intake price ratio. 1.0 I restaurant yet, set cart Fair Haven Farmer's Market every Thursday summer early Fall, I look forward getting one delicious quesidillas.  The amount tasty food get five dollars amazing--and make watch. I swear I going get restaurant week; I miss quesidillas! 5.0 This FAR best Mexican food New Haven area. $6 gets anything menu delicious. The portions HUGE happy make custom dishes allergies food restrictions. The lunch cart York st also amazing get dishes $5! The veggie tacos great get 3 sides rice beans, burritos huge. 5.0 Let's kindly remember I'm California therefore authority Mexican food. Now we've got fact way . . . I'm writing specifically food cart YNHH, always favorite cart.  Love veggie burritos!  I know first person put sort shredded cabbage burrito, yes please!

My personal favorite beef quesadilla - comes rice, beans, mango salsa, guac, etc. The staff lovely, kids entertain waiting food. The day, I discovered set cart across street Roomba burrito cart. Stopped lunch got thing $5.00. Now that's lunch bargain get much Roomba cart. Loved it, great. 5.0 Best size-to-price ratio burrito New Haven, hands-down without sacrificing quality. Bring tinfoil, 'cause ain't finishing it. 4.0 Fast, inexpensive, delicious, authentic Mexican.  Runs circles around crappy excuse Mexican Fresh Taco Elm St. may fast inexpensive, also un-delicious inauthentic.  Fresh sauces good rices beans.  Yum. 4.0 La Carreta better known carts med school Science Hill, mom n' pop business grown they've set shop State Street.  Primarily takeout place, tables.  My first visit pick food amusing b/c owners' three sons frolicking "dining area" I keep picking counters putting back solid ground run risk cracking skulls open.  I really like "mole" I usually get enchiladas, I'm sure options, burritos, tacos, etc. disappoint. 4.0 Great sandwiches...this one puts subway chains shame. Everything super fresh , personal favorite tuna melt. It delicious melts mouth. One thing absolutely worth mentioning people run place. They extremely friendly hospitable, makes feel welcome make sure revisit. Highly recommend tuna melt, Reuben, chicken cutlet sandwich , jersey burger, veggie sub. 5.0 The menu huge, I've never bad sub here. Amazing customer service! Cheesesteaks one best jersey! 5.0 Place empty I high hopes good sub. Boy I wrong!!  My son got 1/2 club sub I got 1/2 meatball parm. The bread fresh meatballs like home cooking delicious marinara sauce. The 1/2 subs big either us finish. This place highly recommended. 5.0 I hungry discovered place near bank. Very clean relaxing atmosphere inside every employee pleasant. I tried buffalo chicken sub jalapeños awesome. Complete chips drink $8. I'll returning! 5.0 Great product, great service, courteous staff, clean environment. They obviously care lot business. Oh, subs great :) 5.0 Ive known nick many years, owns sub shop dissapoint! Besides easy eyes, took extreme care making picky order making perfect. Brought home subs brother girlfriend 3 us beyond pleased food. Nick great guy, smells unbelivable, continue recieve business. Thanks hoagie nick! 5.0 Disappointed Thai food.  Ordered Pad Thai chicken, favorite Thai dish mine.  It hands worst Pad Thai I've ever had.  The dish bland egg chicken. 1.0 Worst experience I ever Japanese restaurant!. The waitress rude snippy. There 4 us- 3 ordered all-you-can-eat 4th ordered another special (same price) included appetizer, entree dessert. When waitress started bring food told 4th person, "Do NOT eat" Okay I understand whole concept "you can't share" come really??? The person embarrassed I.The food came odd times. For example, 4th person got steak 20 minutes got roles. The waitress forgot put role order got 2 roles. When asked rude!!!! The whole experience horrible. It cheap bill either. They offered take 15% I argued take all-you-can-eat price one person get sushi all! I emailed say upset I (because I regular customer) I get reply.  DON'T GO!!! Go Kumo Sushi X instead. 1.0 Friday night "all eat" sushi sounds good right? Not. My wife's dinner never showed up. I practically done sushi came apologized delay. We complained...so offered lousy 10% discount -- meal. Needless say got left. I decent piece salmon sushi greasy tempura. Tuna white tuna average. We back. 1.0 chinese food good ,but sushi  is un fresh. 2.0 Love food. Service little slow, friendly. I love eat often times forget bring things order, people order menu others eat makes difficult eat time. 4.0 Call advance hot pots. Here good big group/social events couples. I also order delivery New Haven areas regular basis. The drivers/delivers usually friendly. I've ordered Formosa kinds occasions. The thing I tried Sushi... After all, Chinese restaurant (which good it) "fusion" Sushi. Overall, positive experience kinds occasions--dine (couples/big groups: hot pots regular dishes), take out, delivery individuals big caterings--here. 4.0 Good food service! I've back couple times usually get buffet. For descent price, sample variety rolls, etc. I'm sure I'll back!.... 4.0 This one step away "china-town worthy".  Food fantastic, despite reviews, service good too.  Don't expect fast service kitchen table though--it's kind place.  Ranks right Lao Szechuan Milford/Orange.  Very good. 4.0 Amazing sushi, awesome steamed dumplings, green tea really good service. Will recommend go back again. 4.0 Good sushi...real good value. All eat 20.00, teriffic price.  Loved Godzilla Roll... 4.0 Bought Groupon place back finally went around Christmas use it.  What good choice!  The food solid, tasty service quick.  They eat sushi (not Groupon-eligible) 2 party said second Sushi Palace Hamden...quite compliment. 4.0 I tried place yesterday thought different staff friendly, helpful wish English little better I could better understand answers questions.  Food fresh menu pretty good.  Service quick. 5.0 admittedly asian food expert.  but love place.  the food yummy. 5.0 Best food around.  I used go every couple weeks.  Never bad meal. 5.0 Went last night. Very impressed! I got $21.95 eat sushi. Comes quick hostess waitress really personable! My new sushi restaurant. 5.0 My father lives Taiwan I grew eating Taiwanese/Chinese food.  I find quality deliciousness Formosa's food unsurpassed Chinese restaurant CT.  I often order takeout easy dinner parties friends rave make feel like champion little effort. 5.0 restaraunt AMAZING!!! The service impecable. The entire staff friendly knowledgable cuisine. I yet dish I like. Hands best asian restaraunt New Haven county. They something everyone, sushi pasta fish meat. It there. 5.0 Authentic? Not even close. But all-you-can-eat sushi great deal pretty tasty (as much could reasonably expect all-you-can-eat anything). The servers friendly top things, never waiting long another round food beers. I've never left feeling warm contentment, mild shame, imminent food coma comes gorging much sushi. 3.0 Haven't since 2011, probably favorite restaurant ever providing authentic Sichuan food (at least time) somewhat secret menu. My memorable experience taking someone fairly late night pouring rain, road seemed like hour more, ultimately everyone agree food totally worthwhile. Before visited quite often, sometimes got free stuff like milk tea ice cream. May fried ice cream once. Regardless whether free, very, good. There one lovely waitress I really liked. The Dry Sautéed Sliced Fish Pot incredible, robust piquant full exotic spices. Sliced Fish Soft Bean Curd also excellent oddly great refrigerated. I liked subtle sweetness it, though dish obviously mostly spicy savory. I keep ordering things  in NYC Boston, never nearly good. My parents first Spicy Szechuan Sliced Tripe Sliced Beef Tendons 2008, experience fish dishes, kept trying replicate experience elsewhere, ultimately realized luck items peaked here. It's bad I can't see ever area again. Also had: Beef Wraps, Tea Smoked Duck, Cumin Lamb, Sauteed Zucchini, Chinese Style Kung Pao Chicken. All good, though peak level. 5.0 We've never restaurant, I can't comment it. For delivery, guys pretty great.  Their delivery time reasonable.  The food touch expensive side chinese food, portions generous whatever.  The food pretty good, especially delivery, although outstanding.  They fortune cookies, bit disappointment kids (ok, let's honest, disappointment me) although send little fried wonton cracker noodle things.   We've ordered guys several times now, they're go-to delivery chinese food. 4.0 Awesome restaurant places North Haven CT! We took All You Can Eat deal impressed. The portions plenty sushi fresh well presented. Will definitely go back wish try something extensive regular menu. 5.0 I like place everything fresh really clean restaurant! A little funny crew works makes smile every time. Food really good sushi chef Mike makes best rolls around. I wonder place always slow. Good work guys, keep up! 4.0 I've ever gone Formosa all-you-can-eat special. The sushi best around great appetizers. It's bit pricey I usually make special occasion go worth get. 5.0 I've sushi here, okay. Definitely best eat area, couple miles away home bad. I go way come here, I really craving sushi feel like going far, would do. Their seaweed salad gross, though. 3.0 Amazing General Chicken, best I've ever had. Dumplings really good 4.0 Talking great Taiwanese home-cooked meals!!  I went husband dinner work couple weeks ago recommended family member. The inside restaurant clean represented fine dining restaurant casual you're-typical-Chinese takeout.  The price reflect that. We ordered family-style menu although section seemed mis-categorized Szichuan style dishes (I confused check waitress).  Again, menu items pricey food delicious!  I thought nice translate menu items English sounds appetizing typical Chinese menus I think (and hoping) encourage familiar Taiwanese/Chinese cuisines try out. It first visit food hit spot! One small complaint one waitress handling tables time help owner/manager (I presume lady reception area was) every took things come us, getting bill etc. I definitely recommend place anyone interesting trying authentic Taiwanese cuisine.  I come back special occasions. 4.0 This place (aside sushi, etc.) Taiwanese (Formosa Taiwan's nickname), Chinese. Granted, cuisines pretty close find differences. My wife Taiwanese craving food home country made trek Glastonbury check place out. Totally worth it! Owners majority waitstaff legit Taiwanese I let wife order Mandarin everything kind surprise recommended waitress Jesse. Beef noodle soup, rainbow fish tofu casserole, spicy shredded bamboo shoots sautéed bean stem. All freaking delicious. HIGHLY recommended. Guaranteed good authentic going get CT. 5.0 I went Formosa tonight family hearing great things food eat deal.  When got there, one waiter one hostess.  The waiter running ragged hostess like sloth.  It took least 10 minutes drink order taken much longer food order.  After hour sitting there, food finally came out.  It decent nothing extra special.  By time annoyed tired sitting wanted leave.  They left check list us order second round eat sushi want wait another hour next round.  The waiter apologetic offered us free dessert decided it.  It huge disappointment waist money eat enough sushi paid.  The food may better aggravated time got it, understaffed, slow kitchen, decent food, I would going again. 2.0 This place I expected. They way priced portions get. The food bad good either. Would I go prob 3.0 Formosa probably best restaurant Chinese food New Haven area. I tried sushi yet Chinese food authentic. With said, place uses quite bit msg prices higher end. My recent trip hot pot. Its $21 dollars per person (not eat decent amount food). The ingredients fresher hot pot Great Wall New Haven. 4.0 My favorite dish continues chili pepper tofu, I takeout eatin across good variety vegetarian dishes, never disappointed.  Consistently good, versus occasionally great! 5.0 Formosa one better Sushi places area. The food always quality I dine in. Over years service improved greatly. It used take forever get food past couple years much efficient. Take out/delivery fast almost always good I'm restaurant. The side tend little expensive sushi places area, bottom line food delicious worth extra dollars. 4.0 Pretty good! All eat Sushi fresh got large pieces. Nice atmosphere. Will go again! 4.0 Got take last night. Not good I thought. Chicken w broccoli cooked lacking taste. Probably  go back. Chicken fried rice decent. 3.0 Ordered delivery last night totally impressed quality taste food. Fresh, flavorful sizeable portions fair price delivered quickly. Thanks yelpers reviews, helped find gem. Chicken wonton soup spinach must. 4.0 Dan Dan noodles really good....My husband spicy pork dish, lacking spice reviewers noted. The service good. Will return? Probably take out. Those noodles pretty good. 3.0 I know Linda B.  Is talking about.  This place still really good must caught night.  I go quite frequently food amazing.  The front desk host friendly helpful always enjoy time here.  I rarely use yelp browsing thorough favorite resturants sad see negative review place speak up.  The flaming chicken Bangkok tower two favorite dishes brought back original sushi chef (Mike)  so sushi amazing.  They usually bar tender Friday Saturday nights that's great option too. Amazing food amazing place.  Still five stars going strong!!! 5.0 I never write reviews, felt compelled today's experience warn others decline quality restaurant's food.  I've eaten multiple times past 4 years always enjoyed dishes crispy whole fish, seafood nest, soups, sushi rolls.  My family I went today celebrate husband mother's birthday ordered crispy whole fish, seafood nest, royal duck, Bangkok tower, various soups (wonton, hot sour, miso).  My mom enjoyed hot sour soup, broth wonton miso way salty.  Whereas seafood nest flavor seafood (lobster tail, scallops, shrimp) overcooked rubbery.  The royal duck also overdone tasted almost like jerky meat Bangkok tower burnt aftertaste.  Fortunately, crispy fish okay, good one I've eaten past.  The service bit spotty well.  We asked served family style said course to, bringing main dishes, server took away plates.  And upon served sushi roll, server gave us one pair chopsticks single dipping dish share 4 us.  After asked dipping dishes, server proceeded bring us one large plate.  One previous reviews mention restaurant new management shows.  It's unfortunate, use good authentic Chinese restaurant. 1.0 Get take lunch time great sushi rolls even better dinners.  Pricing good delivery prompt. 4.0 Nice little place. My girlfriend I arrived right closing Friday night. Very skeptical start restaurant trick. We sushi pretty decent. The service rather mediocre however hostess lady extremely pleasant even offered gf complimentary ice cream restaurant supposed closing. I think there's something said friendly business like that. I'd love give 4 stars however food 4 star quality. 3.0 Don't try anything "fusion."  It never tastes good over-priced.  I'm told excellent Taiwanese dishes.  I know qualifies excellent Taiwanese dish, I comment there. The last time I came Formosa, I all-you-can-eat sushi: disappointing.  Nothing special sushi, I found menu rather limiting, especially compared All-You-Can-Eat sushi places, Sushi Palace Sushi X.  Worse, made us use slip paper again, telling us "cross out" previous order.  This, course, resulted confusion orders never came out... things previously ordered want second time around would come.  Furthermore, took forever dishes come out. Don't come All-You-Can-Eat sushi fusion dishes, Taiwanese friends right, come Taiwanese dishes. 2.0 I've coming family years.  I've best service weekdays.  Best lunch-special style take-out sushi deals. 4.0 I eaten times...usually pretty good. Ate last week really game...haven't back since. 3.0 I took girlfriend birthday. We wanted something different, reading reviews yelpers convinced us give try. I glad did! Waitstaff, atmosphere, food, service A+ around. The menu tremendous offering filled authentic szechan items regular Chinese fair America come expect. Also full sushi menu. We started pot stickers chicken tons (from szechuan appetizer list). I read reviews recommended them. The pot stickers best I've had, chicken tons awesome. The waitress actually asked made decide order usually ordered people know are. She thrilled going try them. Won-ton soup hot sour soups delicious. For entrees sesame chicken romeo juliet (combo general tsos chicken shrimp). We shock came table. The portion size could feed army! At first thought items little expensive side 18-20$ each. That immediately changed meal served. I probably enough left two lunches! Don't let location fool you. From outside looks like hole wall. The neon lights amusing. Inside anything but! Its nice atmosphere. I definitely going back near future try new items. Next time try sushi! 5.0 This pan-Asian fusion restaurant somewhat desolate Middletown Avenue unexpectedly good me.  One look neon lights I expecting worst, step door led relatively sophisticated decor decidedly Chinese (mostly Szechuan) inspired menu. Of course sushi bar pan-Asian favorites mammoth menu, one look specials -- fish spicy bean sauce -- made mind cut chase. I disappointed wish selection. A whole, huge fresh fish brought steaming hot. I could get enough heat flavor dish. The fish perfectly tender flaky. I'm glad I trusted gut went special; exactly that. My date sushi, mango roll, also delicious. It unique take classic tuna roll healthy portion tuna avocado. The twist thinly sliced mango atop roll. The salty sweet combination really sang sushi dipped soy sauce. 3.0 I eaten number different times. I've dined taken out. The food consistently delicious.  However, make sure go plenty time service great. Everyone always friendly tend forget you. 4.0 Another good asian restaurant north haven. This asian fusion sushi restaurant chinese restaurant. Ive steak formosa, filet mignon covered amazing reduced wine sauce Gorgonzola sauce. The portabella mushroom rolls seafood wontons also delicious. Im sushi eater ones know say Formosa one best places sushi 4.0 First I want say food pretty good received half ordered. It slow inattentive service party received may Saturday ordering "All eat sushi" I think matter order get least quick service. Our evening began 6pm seating promptly received menu drinks. We sent order got drinks. When food came, noticed half arrived. Our server came around asked wanted anything else said would like rest order last time saw server least 30mins. We even get refill water server came around original menu order asked anything else needed. Again circled spoke server stating would like things circled. As waited server, several parties seated getting food, drinks, better service leaving table watched. Our server came back one thing reminded several times get 2 7 things ordered. We order fried calamari came table cold soggy. When told server took back bring new one. This whole ordeal took 2 hours received check rate seemed inflated assumed tip included even though think service given. My friend left tip table left. On way car, server (not server) came outside looking tips us. It unbelievable evening unnecessarily long, leaving hungry restaurant wanted money us. I never someone snub tip rude I shocked actually sent someone us tip. As I understand tip suppose based quality service received I think made wait extra 2 hours tip. My friends frequent customers restaurant excited take highly underwhelming disappointing. I would recommended takeout looking eat sushi  within timely manner I would opt restaurant cares customers come doors, ones order alcohol full dinners. 1.0 Hi there. I want tell horrible experience I family valentines day restaurant. We read multiple reviews online well word mouth saying good restaurant is. We arrived around 6pm. We greeted seated. We sat waited 10 minutes anyone acknowledge us table. Someone finally came menus walked away. There introduction ask wanted anything drink. About 5 minutes later different person came asked would like drink ready order. We said would like water drink wanted eat sushi. He left table came back sushi menu water. We ordered shumai, teriyaki chicken, edamame sushi rolls. The food literally came 2 minutes quite surprising. The shumai hard cold unedible. The teriyaki chicken grilled chicken breast sauce glopped top. The sushi rice warm unapetizing since I pay $50 meal I managed choke down. As eating one coming ask things want anything else. There random people came clear plates away. Fast forward another 10 minutes hostess seats couple next table asks ready order. We explain bit confused whole situation since dont seem one person waiter explains us actually two waiters (Mike Pho) sharing duties. Ok say ready order food.  So brings menu open realize menu ordered first round from. Strange thought since might decide order different items. So circle new choices 4 sushi rolls edamame. This hostess comes back takes menu explain want circled. She walks away Mike comes back menu explain confused circled items want time. He leaves us sit wait time 10 minutes food come. When comes, sushi edamame. We start eat sushi realize sushi rice warmer last sushi rice couldnt even eat it. So leave table. Mike came one point waiting food children wanted ice cream brought two bowls vanilla ice cream them. Once decide arent eating anything else sit wait another 10 minutes anyone come tell Mike want check. The amount 52.00 honestly walk without paying experience terrible. I wasnt sure check went front desk waited someone there. The hostess brought second menu came took payment. I sure staff overwhelmed particular night service usually extremely disappointed. Not that, food made wife sick night. We dont plan coming back restaurant definitely give opinion asked. A disappointed customer. 1.0 Looking someplace inexpensive get quick lunch, headed Formosa lunch menu. Having never before, high hopes. The interior decorated give nice atmosphere, exterior dated, let deter you. The lunch menu priced perfectly (the dinner menu considerably expensive) always, good way judge place without breaking bank. Tom Shredded Pork Garlic Sauce--although chili pepper designating "spicy", neither us found be. The sauce great flavor dish plentiful, tasty fried rice side. I Chili Pepper Sichuan Style chicken--not exactly I expected, chunks chicken sauteed roasted jalapenos (I expected red pepper kind sauce). However, still pretty good bit heat, nothing overwhelming. We wonton soup well start pleasantly surprised find wontons stuffed chicken instead traditional pork. In all, left content. Can't say we'd come often nice place grab quick lunch! 3.0 Absolutely stunning food trying almost everything menu I say delicious well. When walking see kitchen pristine staff professional. The menu expansive even people adventurous eaters find something amazing order. I go somewhat regular basis often bring new people time. My complaint would seem short staffed getting hold waitress prove tricky. Especially party bar. 4.0 So much seems changed since good days Formosa. My last visit party 3 sushi buffet, boy, bad experience service. We proceeded sit tick little checkboxes orders, IGNORED. We made eye contact bunch waiters/waitresses (they seem share tables here), really one came aid. I understand busy night, said friendly "We'll minute?" After seemed eternity, took order. The food slowly came in, various things come. Others came far greater portions indicated. Afterwards, indicated waitress order noodles come. She told us somehow order never entered system, put now. We rounded meal ice cream, course brought wrong flavor ice cream. Although I'd love believe simply bad night go, boyfriend went cousin months ago same, worse, treatment. It used waiters waitresses really appeared wanted there. Now feel like anymore. What happened favorite restaurant?! 4.0 After sitting down, first thing likely notice number options - menu large and, like limited Chinese food experience, likely unfamiliar several options. Basically, cooked General Tso, I recognize it. Considering this, useful go someone familiar sort cuisine help find best dish. Prices place. For example, side edamame costs $6, made die little inside. However, appetizers main dishes much reasonably priced. I found food good tasting, particularly cumin beef. The meat tender, spicy enough notice make reach water glass, hot exercise pain-tolerance. I would recommend coming looking something little different standard Americanized Chinese food. If want pork fried rice egg roll, probably find better deal elsewhere. 3.0 Every time I've Formosa, I've gone friend mine knows menu inside out, knows exactly order. We've always eaten 'Family Style' ordering bunch dishes sharing, I think way go, especially larger groups. I've really enjoyed everything I've eaten cumin beef po tofu. Formosa great food. Unfortunately, also oily food. So use issues oily food, double edged sword. So may affect future visits. I think I'll try sushi I go again. 3.0 The best Asian Asian Fusion Connecticut according many yelpers... they're right! From outside, looks like remodeled old dive diner far, Formosa best thing palate New Haven area. The service good waitstaff speak English. I'd recommend asking Chinese menu (it translations) skip Orange Chicken-type American fare. The portions good price (had plenty take pack up). I tried "fusion" items, definitely back. 5.0 used go Restaurant often, recent disappointments. The menu gotten pricey, food gone hill typical "take Chinese food" tripled price. The last 2 times visited service terrible daughter get find waitress waiting long. To top reason would never returning customer would allow daughter order kids menu & shes 10 & would Never able finish entire meal! Way go Formosa, save bucks u lost entire family customers! must say lunches still good price~ 2.0 Formosa really good restaurant go to.  Here's why: 1.  They really good Szechuan Chinese food.  Their cumin beef really good po fu.  Great tasting nice spicy (but get mild want way). 2.  They really good appetizers.  I really like jjajangmyeon also fine chasiubao also excellent fu qi fei pian.  :D 3.  Service good. 4.  It's crowded. It's definitely favorite mine getting authentic, good chinese food.  The place tucked away middletown ave whole ton people going often.  Oh btw, serve sushi, too. 4.0 I've hoooked spinach & chicken wonton soup 2 weeks. It's flavorful, identifiable, inexpensive broth wonderful.  Their shumai shumai. It like type Thai dumpling. I like (although I love Thai dumplings).  The mushroom spring roll fantab.  The hand rolls little thin acceptable. Not great. I yet dine-in I look forward full experience. 3.0 Love chicken wonton .. So fresh MYSTery meat! Lol Also try vietnam roll:) 5.0 This "fusion" restaurant answer Asian food- loving dreams!  While I enjoy customary favorites Thai Chinese, I also able get partner try food Asian side. He loves Crazy Bow-Tie pasta, spicy hot chicken pasta dish willing try dishes. Ahhhh, peace reigns last. The staff helpful friendly. The food plated beautiful manner often flowers dish. A relaxing dining room makes favorite unwinding spot. 5.0 This average Chinese food better places New Haven area. Don't mistaken, though: great means. We started pan-fried vegetable dumplings ($6) well-made nicely presented plate. Next shared "spicy bean curd szechuan style" ($10) Chinese menu (ask menu specifically). Ask without meat; comes meat default, stated menu. It basically mapo tofu, decently made, though could spicier, addition black pepper Szechuan peppercorns. Next "broccoli formosa black bean sauce" ($10) exactly name suggests: broccoli soy-black bean sauce. Again, tasty, nothing mind-blowing. Kudos Formosa offering brown rice (though costs extra $1 per small bowl). The service friendly, though particularly attentive fast. The decor pretty nice, bad place take date, though lights kept way bright. Formosa also serves unusual sushi items bunch random Japanese pasta dishes. It's like they're trying cater anyone everyone. If sick subpar Chinese offerings New Haven, Formosa might worth drive you. 3.0 We've tried Formosa times now, lived expectations.  Weirdly, every non-sushi dish SO ordered gorgeous almost tasteless -- I've tasted them, confirm.  I've stuck basic chicken dishes, quality's erratic -- broccoli chicken, example, delightful once, oily heavy another time.  The sushi good, nothing rave about.   For adventurous diners, menu (what looks us like) authentic Chinese items, featuring example inside parts animal Americans seldom see, much less eat. 2.0 Not years ago. Used cutting edge, fusion style food.  Now, really much different Asian restaurants area. I sushi - bad. I think bad meal here, longer something special. 3.0 I really enjoyed beef red pepper cumin. It strong peppery flavor prominent cumin I thought uncommon Asian food. We also shrimp garlic sauce also fairly good, definitely second fiddle beef dish. This place definitely worth searching taking road trip Connecticut want settle old rest stop fast food. 3.0 I came LARGE group yesterday late lunch, (there 18 us total). -- place: clean, slightly avg casual dining Chinese restaurant -- service:  fast, charge 20% tip large group, fact, charged us 23%... -- food:   This place apparently specializes Taiwanese Szechuan food. We ordered many dishes detail everyone here. I remember: -- eggplant fried -- EXCELLENT, tasty one -- Szechuan spicy tendons -- fish w/ black bean paste sauce -- Zi Ran lamb Szechuan dishes spicy personal taste. egg paste soup really great. -- cold creme brulee another imitation dessert, order one. -- pricing, expensive $22-23 per person bill, I'd given place 4 star rating. But now, pricey food. 3.0 Slowwwww service bordering inattentive.  We sat 20 min I get ask kids soup. I never received mine.  Food interesting normal - shumai normally simply shrimp spiced additional greens such. Dirty plates left lingering table least 15 min.  We ended moving adjacent table ourselves.   A shame place feel joint provided much enjoyable experience. 2.0 Interesting decor outside, may turn some, definitely look past give place try. I'm glad I did! Service excellent, inside decor muted (read: less neon, traditional, nice romantic feel). As previous reviewer noted, definitely ask translated traditional menu offered you: lots great authentic Sezchuan/Chengdu offerings, great love spicy foods! Wish Taiwanese offerings, one would expected given name (Taiwan originally called Formosa). Would give place 5 stars except tad pricey, use quality ingredients definitely far superior Chinese-American restaurants. Sushi outstanding (roll real crab it, artificial crab places use). Lunch specials $6-8, include soup egg roll rice. Large portion lunch special (easily entree size places, great value). 4.0 Kidney, tripe, three different kinds intestine dishes chef's specials. Pros: Pretty unique Chinese/ Taiwanese food Northhaven, CT. The spicy tripe appetizer, fried rice good. Definitely get fried rice. Most chinese food area sucks. Cons: The intestine dish ( I think got one brown sauce) kind bland. I care much consistency intestines. Will update review I try things. 4.0 Fantastic! We got moo shu chicken, best I've ever - unique delicious...didn't even need extra hoisin sauce! Also got Peking duck, I years delicious I remember. For appetizers got roast pork bun scallion pancakes. Both great. The price reasonable, too. We got $40. Highly recommended! 5.0 must ask authentic chinese menu... prices expensive side dishes absolutely yummy...and pretty high standards chinese food (coming southern CA...)... 4.0 Review based one visit I know I've tasted small sample. Dim Sum Saturday (you order menu - carts). Atmosphere upscale. Tea served cast iron pot. Impression first dish great dumplings lukewarm dipping sauce ice cold straight refrigerator. The temperature dish putting flavor delicateness dumpling wrapping quite good. The next 2 things I (I ordered 3) ballpark. Vegetable bean-curd skin roll delicious rice noodle wrapped shrimp also wonderful. I enjoyed every bite. And Dr. Henry Lee family also! I can't wait go back sample menu. 5.0 Formosa definitely best Asian Fusion restaurant state.  And hands best authentic Chinese restaurant state.  The staff incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, helpful.  The sushi chef creates magnificent rolls--you always tell restaurant good neat tight sushi rolls are.  Formosa's sushi artful delight eat.  For interested Chinese cuisine CT, I honestly say, Thank God Formosa.  While looking purely Chinese restaurant might turned fact marketed Asian Fusion, need go once, order Chinese food, forever addicted.  There almost restaurant class--if want suggestions particular dishes, I'd happy share (too many discuss one review). 5.0 For price atmosphere everything offered, definitely right THE MONEY. The kind place intimate date two large rambunctious gaggle drunks. Our girl crush date consisted following: "The Warrior" Scorpion Bowl 2 Seaweed salad gal liked (with crispy japanese pickles girl didn't) Crab cakes lemon grass sauce ridiculous branch rosemary speared center- hot pipin' fresh, silly delicious A plethora sushi rolls, including: enchanting Mexican roll (a Mexican burrito, fajita, enchilada, chimichanga, nacho fixins' ASS-MAZING!!!!!!), American Dream roll- perfect combination subtle ingredients much like persona American spirit red, white, blue tobiko; finally Spice Girl Roll chosen name rather ingredients, equally enchanting par friends south's tortilla Mexican roll. Next fatties still hungry scorpion bowl die! From secret, special Chinese Taiwanese menu ordered delicious dish chicken abalone mushrooms intrigued us caused us question truth realities culinary arts eternity. If understood review- BRAVA! If please take dinner Formosa make delicious Asian Fusion Love Buddha savor. Very nice. 5.0 The BEST restaurant North Haven hands down.  The dining room spacious wait staff great.  The food downright AWESOME.  I sushi pan asian meals.  A favorites Szechuan raviolis, Mexican Roll, Green Tea Tuna, Szechuan Veggies, I could go :) If offering banana spring rolls desert pass up. ***Edit 1/8/08*** Make sure ask  "Chinese menu" authentic Szechuan Taiwanese food.  That menu order since found it.  The food best I ever had!!!  The water boil beef great specify want way supposed HOT :)  There dim sum Saturday Sunday afternoon.  It awesome well.   Also,  one night saw Doctor Henry Lee !  Cool!!! 5.0 There  Asian restaurant wonderful. Its right street  from  where I live first time I California  Roll contains rice, seaweed wrap crab meat raw avocado. I scared first friend mine said  don't want try sushi try California Roll. I I hooked. The service good even happy hour3-6 pm.  Hey try place  I did. want big gathering party room 70 people. 5.0 Checked spot Newark. Staff friendly. They gave us bread table delicious. I angel hair vodka shrimp. Food great portion huge lunch time. 4.0 I sub AWFUL lady gave ends meat sub like chunks horrible. The place dirty needs remodel AVOID people 2.0 got subs day ...  good food   quick delivery 4.0 I eat time. The food good staff helpful. Service always top notch. 4.0 Horrible horrible customer service. I literally walked clerks' attitudes. Never seen anything like it. No thank you. 1.0 I work near Subworks often place large sub orders feed staff lunch working Saturdays.  Yesterday, I placed order 11:45 delivered 1:00 pm.  It order 8 subs, smaller orders I usually place.  At 12:55, I received call Stephanie saying order going ready 1:00 pm.  I said "that's ok, long think be?".  She put Barbara, manager, phone.  Barbara proceeded complain busy working order placed mine 40 subs repeated order would ready.  I asked I told I called busy fill request.  I would called another place.  She responded with, "so want cancel order?".  Of course I cancel staff going break lunch 5 minutes I food give them.  Barbara apologize mistake instead made feel like order huge inconvenience her.  Well, I ordering visiting Subworks ever again. Barbara worry orders inconvenience ever again! To owner Subworks, I'm sorry inform lousy manager caused lose future business incredibly rude way speaking good customers. 1.0 Small place.  There seating, there's atmosphere.  Great take-out sandwiches. 3.0 Meatballs angel hair Al vodka. $11.50. Comes small salad bread. Great hungry. Takes 30 minutes make.  Call ahead. 4.0 Subworks one quietest food franchise around states possibly nation. I believe I say food good, I mean it. I visited eaten many, many times. My first order restaurant Turkey Sub lettuce, pepper, salt, vinegar olive oil regular oil. When I say good, freaken explosive freshness taste buds. Compared corner stores also deli franchise really it. Sometimes I dine friends, I ask tomatos tasted 1000x tastier. Speaking makes mouth watery! They great variety foods soups, subs, pizza, sandwiches, etc. also staff friendly interactive. :) 5.0 I used love place Xunta-a authentic Spanish tapas bar, casual, informal bar tapas great atmosphere - I went years, bringing many town visitors friends happy hour weekends. Now, sadly, I say Nai place worth spending money there. The new owner made lot changes, worse, imo, strange (looks like dude Queens)-he seems always there,with scowl face, neither inviting welcoming, acts dismissive like  doing favor even talking  you-when even show early reservations done nothing except wanting patronize bar! He runs place like formal dining restaurant..it feels like exactly time, spend pricepoint, get out-all anti-tapas bar me. At  birthday celebration 10 people, actually ask us leave 2 hours "needed" table though spent several hundred dollars still eating drinking! I flabbergasted rude was.  Also I noticed since change Nai, food good used (octopus dishes cooked well), higher prices well, sangria also watered down/sweet imo--just good value. And décor blah (think tacky flamenco paintings homedecorators.com)-does charm personality old Xunta. Sadly, giving go couple times, I search authentic Spanish tapas bar. 1.0 Unremarkable - tried 8 dishes expecting blow socks given high reviews I mislead Yelp rating! Does hold candle next Boqueria. 2.0 Pros -Decent value -Friendly kind service -Accommodates large groups Cons -Tons loud groups -Not intimate 2.0 Nothing special. 3.0 Came date Saturday night. We reservation since 10 minutes late (well, DATE ten minutes late...) wait table. So put us downstairs bar packed. When I say packed, crowded restaurant I've New York.  We 10 feet away bar room size apartment (not big) people eating meals sides us. I felt bad since ass right face. I understand try accommodate many people there's room. Anyway, half hour got table. This table closest main entrance, I would recommend it. I think chair got kicked least 20 times throughout night. I enjoy fact live music cigar roller workin night. I wanted see could roll something else dinner since tools looked damn good felt like might best decision. The food good, complaints I think I'll back Friday Saturday night. Best try slower night packed. 3.0 place nice vibe, tapas delicious reasonably priced. went friend thursday night around 7:30 pm, right flamenco show. great time looking performance, sangria one best one i've lately, service friendly. 4.0 I came two people book club meeting. It happy hour, ordered $10 half-pitcher mango sangria, DELICIOUS. Also, almost food ordered (tortilla, potatos w/ aioli, tropical salad) flavorful well-made. My friends ordered chorizo onions, looked smelled good, (I I'm vegetarian). The exception asparagus tapas, actually pretty gross--I force eat I hate wasting food. There two small pieces asparagus, horribly overcooked mushy (possible can), cold, drenched mayonnaise. Our waiter friendly engaging arrived, cool long pour sangria, though seemed forget us later on. But overall, positive experience I recommend place. 4.0 We stumbled across place, wonderful delight. The food delicious service great friendy. Wonderful choice wine. Definitely recommend get chance! 4.0 The food dont tast terrific, also put place charming way. You eat eyes theese peope knows it!

We Thursday night, flamenco dancers incredible!!! 4.0 Excellent spot, much add reviews. 4.0 Made happy really happy little cute look fantastic food 4.0 Food Really good, Service point (it bit early quiet though) price reasonable. 4.0 We twice three weeks; first night Tuesday early hardly anyone there.  But impressed quality food friendly staff.  We returned two weeks later evening Flamenco dancing, got seat right next dance floor.  It great evening--the food good, mango sangria good.  An uneven table caused quite accidental drink spill waiter responded graciously towels...and free pitcher sangria!  We stayed three hours, four five tapas, watched first rate floor show...and got less $100 two.  We definitely back many times. 4.0 Perfect Flamenco performance. Good food, enough. It's ok order more, more... Delicious Sangrias. This place good first date..., I guess obvious. The music loud many distractions. Else, perfect place chill either solo group people. 5.0 I really love place! The service excellent food sangria delicious! I've never bad experience coming here. It's small cozy great atmosphere around. 5.0 Service: Attentive, personable, accommodating Decor: Cool, enchanting, laid-back Food: Phenomenal, addictive, delicious In word: Amazing!

I always love introducing new friends place amazing flamenco shows Thursdays (I think also one weekend) I've seen one Thursday truly magnificent experience. You can't take pictures (it's distracting) good thing something worth experiencing naked eye. 5.0 Everything menu great. My favorite chipirones ink, bacalaos, stuffed olives, salteado de gambas, pretty much everything I've tried! The entire staff extremely friendly eager please. I also love  their food always served HOT. The best part, though, pretty cheap place eat. 5.0 Late last year wife I East Village looking Galician tapas found  Nai. It Saturday afternoon, meal times, place customers. We sat high stool table, looked decently priced wine list (mostly Spanish Argentine good wines), ordered tempranillo, proceeded tackle pimientos de piquillo stuffed cod (to die for), grilled sardines (delicious), exquisite cod croquettes then, la piece de resistance, octopus Galician style (sauteed olive oil pimentón/paprika: like Galicia). At  $5 $6 tapa $11 ración (double size tapa), food caliber steal compared trendier faux-upscale similar establishments catering Catalan Basque tapas West Village. The best way appreciate Nai sit high table, bottle, let tapas flow, see absorb young atmosphere. And found returning Nai several times. Last night, visited pimientos de piquillo stuffed cod; croquettes goat cheese wrapped jamón serrano (delicious); meatballs brandy (quite tasty); grilled chorizos (just reads, left us wanting next time chorizos onion sauce chorizo cider), toppled desert fresh lime-laced strawberries stuffed custard (exquisite). It heartening still many items menu work through..... What brings us back Nai?  Is young low-key atmosphere seems true form tapas places university towns like Santiago de Compostela?  Is warm attentive treatment hands David (the owner) Raúl, genial attendant Basque country?  Is high quality Galician tapas thoroughly authentic, like back Galicia, without contamination "adjustments" fit "what NY market would expect"? I know (but who's asking?)  One think sure: way David co-owner chef constantly solidly deliver goodies, I think I worry high-priced debatable experiments involving chorizos toppled mango cilantro, appear hip. Nai delivers truly needed NY: real, authentic tapas place Galicia, authentic roots food  ambiance, good value. Keep up, guys! Well baaaack!! 5.0 I've Nai times always winds perfect night out. First all, service really top-notch. You're always greeted right away staff seems efficient. The night enjoyed two small pitchers sangria, champagne mango.

Don't think I'd go back. 3.0 Great place. Found reviews Yelp. A great find. Food amazing. Everything came fresh hot. We tried lot lol. We mango sangria good flavor fruit nice. We tried shrimp garlic, yummmm. The cod dips, hamon croquetas, oxtail, tuna empanadas coconut crepe seafood. All dishes amazing. The atmosphere perfect.

This restaurant perfect ambiance amazing food. The four us shared 10 plates enough food. My favorites shrimp garlic fried feta cheese wrapped ham. We also tried meatballs, clams spicy sauce, mussels, croquettes patatas bravas. I would recommend dishes! Hopefully back restaurant next time city. 5.0 My rating restaurant based solely food, also live Flamenco music dance performance. We came fairly large group Saturday night (make reservations ahead time large parties, small place!). For parties larger 10 people pre-fix menu $45 person includes 2 hours unlimited drinks number appetizers. For authentic tapas place, appetizers sub par.  I feel like serious "foody", Sangria delicious. I cannot comment full regular menu, I come back order la carte. The Flamenco show fantastic! The music amazing dancing beautiful, raw, authentic Flamenco. Being dancer, great experience around. I would recommend anyone likes Flamenco music even girls night out, date night bringing parents somewhere cool. 4.0 This place GREAT!!! My friends I went dinner, ended apps unable make decision. We skirt steak, grilled shrimp garlic sauce, octopus virgin olive oil, fried goat cheese braised ox tail = AMAZING, food hot & fresh.

They gave us lot bread good olive oil go it. The bacalao frito bad. My favorite grilled shrimp garlic sauce. So good! I convinced try caracoles...and I right skeptical. I like it. The beef stew best though! Must try! I also tried sangria HH price.  All all, I blast! By time departed around 9pm, line waiting outside. This place good couples small groups. I highly recommend place! 5.0 This cute tapas bar! I came Friday night 9:15pm reservation. (Heads up: came Regal Union Square movie theater distance far, thinking dinner movie date -- welcome.) However, arrived little early - 9pm exact - I guess busy there, wait 15 minutes table ready. My party 5 mind waiting, got bit annoying place wait except doorway waiters constantly say, "Sorry, excuse me," time needed go around us...yeah, pretty small bar. Lesson learned: exactly time reservation. Here's table ordered: - Tortilla Espanola (potato omelette pie): sadly, really plain. Just literally omelette potato. Supposed taste like: "Oh gosh, I mixed eggs potato pie before?" But tasted like: "Oh, eggs potato together. All right." - Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak): My table ordered tapas size (9 pieces). Let's say ate finished it, ordered racion size (15 pieces). DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS ONE. The steak tender ... I'm drooling now. - Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs): surprisingly delicious. It's like never even see coming! - Solomillo la Naranja (pork tenderloin): also delicious! sauce really makes great. - Tabla de Jamon Queso (charcuterie): much I love charcuterie, skip one. There 6 pieces rolled ham 6 triangles Machego cheese. This costs $15. It really depressing plate... - Seafood Paella: Depends one. If sticky rice kind person, paella you. If don't, not. And I know, I sound ridiculous saying this, meat here, would made huge difference. But best paella, $17 pretty cheap. - Patatas Bravas (spicy potato cubes): spicy, good! We also ordered Mango White pitchers Sangria. Each pitcher $28 each. I mainly chose place pitchers sangria (clearly priorities order) great! Overall, I fun experience. The waiters attentive really nice. Oh! There's free bread olive oil. And yes, party one kept asking refills -- waiters gave smile faces! I definitely coming (how I miss GAMBAS?!) since prices pretty decent tapas place (total bill 5 people: $190 including tip - $38 person). Cailin's Recommendations: - Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak) - Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs) 4.0 Went sangria tapas friend's birthday. Made reservation 6:30 PM Thursday night. One friends got time rest us running late. She able seated really nice - wait whole party arrive. We ordered pomegranate blueberry sangria tasted fruity fresh. It still happy hour entire pitcher cost $20. Then proceeded order six tapas (small plates) split three us. The waiter concerned would enough food entirely satisfied ordering. Standout dishes shrimp garlic sauce (ahhh sauce!), potatoes garlic aioli, fried goat cheese. We loved dishes though. Savory, comfort food. Each dish cost $5-8, 6 dishes overly expensive. Overall, really great meal. We left determined go back another time. Highly recommended! 4.0 I went Nai two months ago old friend. It's cute place tucked underground 1st Ave 11th. Going server's recommendation, enjoy Gambas al Ajillo; pretty much anytime douse something garlic sauce I'm gonna like it. The rest meal enjoyable - I've dishes before, I remember enjoying every one. We also showed right tail end happy hour - ended getting discounted pitcher sangria, pretty good (I've never really sangria I've loved, close). Prices reasonable neighborhood. I'd recommend place folks looking tapas area. Would good small group date. 4.0 Went birthday recently food amazing! We shared dishes I tried many- tasty good. The service also awesome, really enjoyable experience! When I went crowded, I see getting packed since huge space. They also great drink specials. 4.0 If ever visited Spain place go! Live Flamenco every Thursday Saturday night! Amazing tapas sangria point! A bit pricey worth money especially live performance! 5.0 We stumbled across place, wonderful delight. The food delicious service great friendy. Wonderful choice wine. Definitely recommend get chance! 4.0 Had 25th birthday last night AMAZING! The food delicious service better.

Just want remind ppl show starts 8:30 Thursday. If u want see show, better mention make reservation. 4.0 Live Flamingo dancer!! Best part night. The service quick food decent. 3.0 LOVE LOVE LOVE place! Great vibe, great food, love plates small, extremely delicious! The blueberry sangria favorite! Amazing staff! Moved back California, I miss place much! Highly recommend! 5.0 It's going really hard write review, rating food drinks, really good. But I appreciate good manager keeps staff checked. When got told pitcher sangria $10 happy hour. We order 2 pitchers 7pm, among several plates. When time pay bill, surprise seeing pitchers full price. And I asked waiter tells one price half pitcher. At point I wanted talk manager, waiter rude manner approached us, claiming misunderstanding miscommunication grabbed bill (which handwritten) tore right front us. As I see things, mistake (totally posible) I would fix pitcher value way say sorry let customer pay bill. At point bill I pay it, talk manager tip waiter course behavior. It seems dubious friends guys destroyed bill without trying come another solution talk it. I consider understanding costumer I answer good rudeness I feel type dishonesty happening I can't let go. Hopefully one person thing I bad luck. 1.0 Their Flamenco dancers thursday nights way past bed time. Not mention $20 happy hour (until 7) pitchers sangria - ordered 3 flavors pomegranate blueberry champagne red favorites! Food: delicious gambas, patatas bravas, paella, mussels, sausage onions, can't forget manchengo cheese. 4.0 The East Village makes angry Nai Tapas makes happy. It also makes travelling 14th street totally worth it. Their appetizers perfect. Not many things world perfect, I feel good knowing Nai Tapas perfect tapas. Every time I gone there, I've awesome experience. Some favorites include shrimp garlic sauce clams mussels. I eat day. The difficulty eating supposed share tapas (so I've told), anything like -you'll want hog everything. Go there, enjoy sangria tapas vibe people around you. This place always awesome 5.0 Great place tapas, great sangría (not sweet, thank you!). The food comes quickly staff very, nice. Thank lovely evening. On saturdays sundays make reservation, place full Flamenco performance. 5.0 We strolled another restaurant 50 min wait. This none especially bar. Actually glad I came flamenco show mostly I needed quiet insane day work conference. We pitcher sangria, alright. We shared tapas, alright. The best octopus tapa. Some others unmemorable. The tapas version paella meh. I fan definitely tasted like steel pan. All I could taste metal. Wouldn't recommend it. The waiter nice though. So, alright. Not sure I'd rush back here. 3.0 Came birthday dinner tried assortment tapas till busting seams: shrimp garlic, calamari ink, fried cod fish, mussels, sardines toast, paella, cheese plate, chorizo, clams, ... list go on!

He friendly instantly joking us. We little hour left happy hour choose wisely pitchers get. We started blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. It delicious quickly disappeared. Round two: We got simple red sangria. Delicious also quickly vanished. I finally found magic act I enjoyed! But wait more. Around 640, received THIRD pitcher mango sangria. I love mango right alley. By time, I opted break seal thinking happy hour over. Boy I wrong. By time I returned, Dave granted us one last pitcher tropical sangria. Again good little sweet I think remember. Now let's math, albeit improperly. 4+4=1. 4 people, 4 pitchers, one hour. Not shabby. They decently strong, pros sangria-ing. By time left line people waiting dinner. I'm sure I would sit dinner I would definitely return pitcher two bar maybe plates tapas good measure. 4.0 Their dark wood tables chairs give cozy feel.   Hard resist $20 pitcher sangria happy hours.  And sangria bad all, liked fill pitcher much ice.   Food pretty good tapas portions enough shared 2-4 ppl.  Very friendly staff. 4.0 Such fun place dinner, especially Saturdays Thursdays flamenco dancers perform.

We enjoyed everything, potatoes creamy garlic sauce & meatballs w/ brandy personal favorite. I could eaten another whole order potatoes! To drink pitcher Blueberry pomegranate champagne Sangria pitcher Mango Sangria. The Blueberry pomegranate AMAZING. Seriously hit spot. Next time I come I would like try small plates like octopus, mussels, croquettes, overall food & service great. 4.0 Now place sorts cute fun. We came Saturday night dinner last minute 10:30 Flamenco show. I never even heard place noticed past even tho I've bakery next door pretty often general, searching eats within area quite often well. I sure expect, experience nothing positive. Our server, Uno, hoot made experience much pleasurable. We ended 7 tapas plates two us filling. Bacalao, skirt steak, ham fried goat cheese, mussels (a little puny side), I can't remember always rest was........ sure place check 4.0 Went friend dinner. We ordered five things: 1) Octopus: so-so. They boil octopus snot-like texture outside. Taste alright best preparation. 2) Chicken Croquettes: Good dish. Would order again. Would benefit sauce (they give croquettes themselves). 3) Coconut Crepe: good dish accurately described menu. It's seafood filled dumpling. Quite good. But crepe. 4) Mussels wine sauce: quite good. Nice sauce preparation. Good amount mussels well. 5) Salad. Besides white asparagus, vegetarian dish menu. I'm avid meat eater. But seriously? Two vegetarian dishes menu 30 items? Seems like laziness. Also getting bill took ages. Overall okay meal. Wouldn't go back, meal bad. 3.0 Great tapas, flamenco guitar n dancing show fantastic. It's repeat list. 5.0 Really disappointing food. We went tapas flamenco Thursday though dancing cool, I waste time here. A ton fried heavy food, even obvious menu. The seafood paella disgusting flavor looked like instant Spanish rice (no joke). Chicken croquettes looked tasted like something buy freezer aisle grocery store. Everything tasted processed. The worst part? Even sangria gross. Their red sangria sugar alcohol. We went since Yelp reviews seemed promising sorely disappointed. 1.0 Brought parents great experience. The food amazing, staff nice, flamenco dancers added extra spice. I highly recommend Tabla De Quesos Y Embutidos even though little pricey small portions flavor spot on. The empanadas also amazing (so far, bad empanadas NYC). If drinking, try sangrias (we got mango die for). This great little place EV I'd say groups 4 less ideal. And make sure make reservation since get pretty packed. 5.0 I went wife family friend tonight. It awesome, food setting. The bartender great, great time. 5.0 A disappointment.  Tapas authentic.  The gambas ajillo unrecognizable ones I Spain.  The squid ink mediocre best.  Sangria respectable, otherwise recommended looking authentic Spanish tapas experience. 3.0 I Barcelona place hang I feel homesick. The pulpo la gallega omelettes awesome. It might little price average city... I can't compare NY prices Spanish ones, I guess. Service best. David, manager, kind nice well bartenders. Stop enjoy tapas Estrella Damm beer!!! 5.0 I Nai couple times.  This time good.  In past friggin standing. I sure happened.  The tapas depth flavor spice past. I would recommend place friends unless I go back get tapas I last year. 3.0 Tried range tapas... Pan Tumaca, Churrasco Arriero, Croquetas De Jamon, Empanadillas De Carne, Pimientos De Piquillo Rellenos.... ok, nothing I'm craving again. Red wine sangria ok, awesome. 2.0 Red sangria gets solid rating sweet great happy hour pricing ($5 large glass pitcher special too). Servers friendly. Place packed Monday night - good sign. Food disappointing. Chorizo overcooked chicken ham croquetas average. Patatas bravas soggy instead crispy/crunchy sauce spicy powered flavors. Go relax friends sangria get good service real food destination. 2.0 This place sort like hood: sloppy, sweet, cramped, little sweaty, messy fun. If like sloppy, sweet, cramped, sweaty, messy fun. It's also pretty cheap. I would wonder it, quality amazing , I wonder, I appreciate overcharge mediocre tapas. I've tried everything menu. I would like say something stands out, would untrue. The chicken good, chorizo ok, asparagus ok, patatas bravas, meh, tortilla espanola, ok. Sangria - white better read. We mango sangria pretty refreshing overall alcohol's sole purpose make food taste better ambiance less hectic. If consider tortilla flats, great Mexican, like Nai Spanish food. It's meh, sometimes good imitation sufficient. 3.0 Great tapas, reasonably priced. The garlic shrimp & chorizo w onions among best I've ever had. Seafood paella great bit fishy side. The skirt steak could sliced bit thinner. Overall pleased food service. Red sangria tops great experience. 5.0 Amazing.  Sangrias, beer, tapas, service, atmosphere.  I even tried enjoyed sardines! 5.0 We stumbled across place, wonderful delight. The food delicious service great friendy. Wonderful choice wine. Definitely recommend get chance! 4.0 NAtive Iberian peninsula I appreciate great spanish cusine.

Also chorizo oxtail amazing. I 4 times continue go spot great Tapas. 5.0 We patatas bravas, escargot, chorizo sautéed onlions mussels spicy broth. Overall excellent food, great place tapas. Cozy ambience. We red wine sangria pomegranate sangria. The drinks great! 4.0 Nai Tapas Bar incredibly fun experience authentic delicious food. The sangria amazing, waiter! I came 7 friends birthday dinner would recommend anyone. Plus, Mon-Wed right $20 pitcher sangria deal! Amazing place. 5.0 This first restaurant friend brought landing NY. There bit wait  the food delicious. Mostly tapas got delicious, one two tapas tasting okay. One thing get: The Blueberry Pomegranate Champagne Sangria!! It's light refreshing, super delicious! I want say worth it, little pricey end tapas. However, I'm California, food definitely cheaper, price may "normal" New York standards. 4.0 The tapas terrible.  The seafood croquettes recommended waiter came horrible mushy chewy. The octopus boiled tasted kinda rubbery.  The empanadas delicious meat filling much dough distracted whole dish.  I like fried goat cheese balls ham bread. Save calories real tapas place.  The waiter nice since I feel like knew happy food. 1.0 sangria variety great, food good.. except octopus :)  I can't say memorable though... 3.0 First time trying tapas definitely last, thanks great experience I here! Service excellent! The waiter helpful offered recommendations. The people nice. Food delicious. We got churrasco arriero (skirt steak), pulp la gallega (octopus), caracoles (escargot), pelotillas de queso de cabra (fried qoat cheese). Everything delicious, got try different flavors! My favorite skirt steak; cooked well dipping sauce tasty. Drinks good too; happen come happy hour. For $4, got big glass sangria really good enough alcohol! Not expensive good food! Definitely come again! 5.0 Absolutely love place, hands favorite restaurant city (I promise I work here!). I discovered randomly 4 years ago (when I think opened), thank Caracas able accommodate party night! All food I've absolutely delicious. I always get gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp), pulpo la gallega (octopus), mussels, potatoes variety stuff. I usually get tapas portions everything split rest table. I've Spain twice food feels authentic. Still tried paella must gotten added menu sometime within last year. Lastly, everything reasonably priced The sangria awesome well- delicious sweet. The service excellent friendly. Don't miss free flamenco shows Thursdays Saturdays 8:30 10:30. The shows awesome run close hour. Make sure make reservation wanna see show, I think around 2 weeks safe. I made last reservation 2 months advance make sure I take parents graduation, bit excessive I think staff little shocked. Overall, feels like little delicious piece Spain middle East Village. I've probably close 10 times I can't wait go back! 5.0 This place pretty legit. As far tapas go pretty solid, granted I eat pork seafood prob missing best dishes, I pretty good. Although Patatas Bravas Asparagus good I hoped, fact kinda bad. The chicken croquets Empanadas point. It's good place crowd, noisy though get know date may better suited elsewhere. The good thing place true Tapas. Everything small 5 bucks order 5 dishes share them! 4.0 Absolute worst restaurant manhattan. Terrible staff, terrible food, terrible time. I would recommend worst enemy. 1.0 Good tapas place. Can little loud otherwise good date place. Recommended: Croquetas De Pollo, patatas bravas 4.0 Remarkable, spot-on tapas served gracious, helpful staff. In many outings Nai, I've yet disappointed dish. Most notable galician boiled octopus paella, often sells given popularity/ ridiculous level deliciousness. However, Nai stands among East Village competitors due superior pacing. If order red sangria, meat dishes arrive first. White? The seafood brought promptly table. They sell awesome, sweet seafood crepe makes perfect savory dessert, conveniently arrives right end meal. Small restaurants New York often driven maximize covers, rushing diners disorganized meals. Nai's consistent attention detail order makes real gem. Wait table, sorry. 5.0 If fan great food cozy environment amazing Flamenco performances, must check place out. There many vegetarian options dishes ordered excellent, except one. What ordered: Patata Bravas - Nice spicy kick sauce Patata Aoli(?) - My second favorite dish garlic aoli top square potatoe fries Coconut seafood crepe - My favorite dish shrimp crab inside small dumpling looking crepes Goat cheese Croquette - Small portions. We got 3 small croquettes... Mango Sangria- Definitely worth it. For $7 get huge glass tangy, perfect sangria. White Asparagus pink sauce - Unlike reviewers said, dish work friends. It mushy plain appetizing. However, waiter kind take bill asked. 4.0 I visiting out-of-town gf found Nai. We wait good hour seat bar, sangria really really good put ease making wait problem. We shared pulpo en su tinta, pulpo gallega, Spanish Omelette jamon queso. I especially enjoyed pulpo en su tinta, gf didn't. She gagged looking enjoying eating octopus smiling w ink sauce mouth.  Maybe I spent several months Spain I unfazed presentation pulpo en su tinta. My plan bring dad go business trip NY June. 5.0 Came Saturday night could catch flamenco show. Ordered couple tapas wine, oh delicious! Everything tried cooked perfectly well seasoned. What stood "gambas al ajillo" "pulpo". You taste difference authentic flair compared tapas places. We seated right front performers delightful enjoy food flamenco dance. Definitely coming back!  warning: place packed weekends, get reservation possible. 4.0 I went twice. The first time I impressed tapas, sangria music (some Manu Chao, Jarabe de Palo, Julieta Venegas). Very tasty quick service. The 2nd time, I went enthusiasm but, despite weeknight again, staff seemed busy/overwhelmed even talk us. The 1st person asked us want, said want table, told us wait. 5 minutes later heard anyone. I asked another person, said she'll check see there's something came back 1-2 minutes later saying there's place bar. Not sure was, seemed empty tables (maybe event prepare for, sure) hungry left. I'll definitely go again, bit mixed reaction. 4.0 The food great here. So Sangria's . The service well I loved entertainment. It would best make reservations. 5.0 Good place!! Small make reservations. We ended eating bar even reservation long wait. Yum tapas good drinks lucky entertainment. 5.0 Really good sangria. Food tasty, lots good options! There still items menu wanted try.... More filling buck tapas places. Would like return dancing! 4.0 Obsessed place!!!  Wait always long food delicious manager/owner nice rarely care wait.  Love food - literally one almost everything menu never disappointed!  Sangria prices excellent too! Highly recommend girls night out, date night, family town, etc -- never brought anyone immediately love it! 5.0 Starting way greeted bar (thanks Dave!), every person came contact us polite, helpful gave great suggestions.  We went 2nd anniversary, perfect night. Especially suggest trying ham croquetas (or croquetas matter), garlic shrimp.  The coconut crepe scallops, crab shrimp also delicious, fried goat cheese never disappoints. Beyond food, also great beer wine list, affordable ($9 - 11 glasses wine).  I must mention staff one time, everyone made us feel welcome felt truly sincere. We definitely plan returning without doubt, since dishes sangria still want try.  Don't forget pick Italian pastry next door way home too. Enjoy! 5.0 One favorite restaurants nyc, though Thursday Saturdays live flamenco music. With complement tapas served here, really perfect evening. I've several times never disappointed. The tapas serve great paella pretty good well. Notables include Gambas, patatas bravas, croquetas, dish sardines chorizo. The paella pretty good addition house bread definitely need dip Gambas oil. The bad criticism I sangria could've lot better tasted bland watered down. Otherwise great restaurant occasion ! 5.0 My husband I looking good Tapas place found one Yelp. Unfortunately I've favorable reviews - food fair service slow. 3.0 A group 6 us went Nai brothers birthday party. Wow! What fantastic time. The foot superb, waitstaff point, flamenco fantastic (just like I remember Spain)! Since brothers birthday invited stage dance. It great night always remember. Thank staff dancers unforgettable evening! 5.0 i'm disappointed restaurant food good, felt many technical conceptual errors tightened up, could made great. none bread toasted.  i know intentional, really felt cold, slightly stale bread took away meal.  the one tapas got toasted bread really paired well curizo, i'm disappointed bread toasted.   sauce asparagus misfire me.  i'm sure made scratch, literally tasted exactly like thousand island dressing pair well asparagus. tortilla somewhat underwhelming bland.  the paella border line inedible salty.  i even necessarily blame that.  it happens. another example careless errors. grilled sardines solid, again, wish came toasted bread.  the Patatas Bravas another solid dish.  the sauce crack.  we got one tapas fried cheese great. meat/cheese platter underwhelming.  felt like suburban dinner party someone opened meat/cheese packet plastic. all, dislike restaurant, disappointed it. great bits, terrible bits, mostly solid, unexciting food.  i would come back again. 3.0 Came past weekend friends birthday, awesome food, weak yummy sangria, pretty rude waiter. First off, food. We got much I'm even sure everything had. Stand outs include coconut crepes, skirt steak, meatballs. You order go careful, start add up! One  things pride sangria selection, ended getting pomegranate blueberry champagne sangria, mango sangria, red sangria, delicious red one kind kick it. I know I drink 6 glasses sangria I expect feel kind buzz after. Lastly waiter super "pleasant rude." He outright rude bit attitude us tended super disapproving take recommendations. Not big deal bit annoying. Go food go flamenco, live dancing weekends! 3.0 This great evening all!!!  First must make reservation want see flamingo dancers Thursday Saturday evening. The décor rustic clean looks authentic, small wood tables, large wooden bar old world wood items make feel like old wine cellar...I like it!! I went group six tried several plates, tasty.  I pleased see make small plates large plates item.  If large group get larger plates much better deal go back seconds All I say get pitcher SANGRIA....don't short change experience!!!!!

The tapas really stood Patatas Bravas - house special sauce brings liiiifeee mee, potatoes perfectly made Croquetas De Pollo - warm cheesy goodness, actually couldnt tell chicken here, mixture melted cheese soooo good. also Croquetas De Jamon less cheesy ham, also great.

Highly recommend! 5.0 Great food really nice staff.  The hanger steak, shrimp garlic sauce, fried goat cheese dishes incredible.  Try squid cooked ink feeling adventurous - pretty fishy, cool experience.   Their sangria pitchers little pricey relative places nearby, half-price pitchers night week.  Also, menu little overwhelming lacks organization. 4.0 I comment food, since I really drink, sangria choices sound amazing! BF brought birthday night. Despite cruddy weather, atmosphere Nai lively upbeat. We got table towards back. The server really friendly answered whatever questions menu items. I think 2 people 5-6 tapas plates good, depending big appetite have. We had: + Churrasco Arriero - skirt steak (fabulous!) + Gambas Al Ajillo - garlic shrimp (make sure bread dipping!) + Caracoles - escargot (also good dipping bread) + Empanadillas De Carne - beef empanadas (very filling) + Croquetas De Jamón - serrano ham croquettes (better chicken one since there's bit saltiness brings flavors) + Croquetas De Pollo - chicken croquettes Overall I would recommend nice evening friends socializing small bites sangria. 3.0 This place overall 3 3.5.

The Gambas Al Ajillo Calimar ink flavorful delicious. I overly impressed Jamon, overall step normal overpriced sensationalized Tapas restaurants indicative Manhattan. Good Tapas involves simplicity good company. 4.0 Very charming place, lots good choices Sangria, must haves Garlic Shrimp (save bread soak sauce) Chorizo dishes. 4.0 I love everything Nai Tapas!! It's great place groups/birthday parties... I've four five times party 5+ everyone always great time. The food delicious (get garlic shrimp dip bread sauce!) expensive, sangria great service good too! I've seen flamenco show twice really fun -- times sitting right front pretty loud, plan deep conversations (lasts 30-45 mins think?). 5.0 Nai Tapas awesome!! Amazing food, great service, centrally located E. Village perfect large groups. Came last night one besties' birthday. We group 10, friend made reservation, restaurant suggested fixed menu $40/ person dinner unlimited pitchers sangria. What could ask $40?! Great price point. This place pretty casual tapas bar - overly romantic fancy means; food authentic, crowd low-key even E. Village, easily could feel like local here. The food AH-mazing. Cannot get it. We stuffed brim yet continued eating stop ourselves. Here dishes brought us menu - 2 portions plate served group (plus baskets bread): - Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp garlic sauce): ***my favorite dish*** - Bacalao Frito (lightly fried fresh cod): fish soft butter dipping sauce tasty - Croquetas de Pollo (chicken croquettes) & Croquetas de Jamon (Serrano ham): good! - Tortilla Espanola (traditional Spanish omelette): probably least fave flavor mild - Patatas Bravas (potatoes coated spicy house tomato sauce): tasty spicy! - Patatas Alioli (potatoes basted creamy garlic alioli sauce): bomb.com! - Charrasco Arriero (skirt steak): awesome dish; meat tender - Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs brandy sauce) - Chorizo la Plancha (grilled Spanish sausage): tasty Wow. We ate LOT!! My fave definitely shrimp & croquettas. Least fave: tortilla espanola (though good, potato-based dishes already served felt excessive). The sangria pitchers kept coming refilled! ** Dessert time (though honestly, room food point?!): The birthday girl one group gluten-intolerant, brought cake dessert. The servers helpful bringing cake candle cut cake us. We didnt stay live flamenco dancing, way sing karaoke street Planet Rose, towards last hour dinner, small band playing live flamenco / salsa music fun atmosphere. We definitely back! Service excellent. Can't wait try dishes menu. I never heard hidden gem glad introduced me. 5.0 I understand place get many 4-5 star reviews. The food less average especially tapas NYC. I  did think sangria good decor nothing special. The service also impress me. I definitely returning here. 1.0 word advice want close seats near flamenco show make reservations week advance want really good seats front flamenco show make reservations two weeks advance. I found out, fact I made reservations two days flamenco show, even guy told "you sitting near flamenco show okay?", I said yes hopes sneaking front flamenco show catch glimpse dance.... boy I wrong, place pretty small stage flamenco dancers even smaller. When I went try get glimpse show, I blocking people sitting bar waiters/waitresses hustling bustling by.  One waiter finally said "you move, blocking everybody." Whoops... anyway flamenco show aside (which pretty awesome seconds I caught it)  food pretty decent. I got blueberry champagne sangria everyone raves it, delicious- bubbly fruity deceptively strong. One bad boys definitely get little tipsy. For tapas friend I shared the: 1) Plates cheese cured meats- I loved manchego cheese- soft delish meats good 2) The fried goat cheese- fried tangy bite it, cheese oozes right out. 3) The garlic shrimp-- sauce thick garlicky great paired bread 4) The clams diavalo -- dish actually came kinda cold, sauce really spicy good  I huge fan. 5) The chorizo quail egg - presentation cute tiny little egg top quit tasty I feel like better without bread bottom chorizo egg. I kinda wish I chorizo dish too. Overall food great waiter (Uno)  was amazing. Would love return try tapas hopefully score good seats 4.0 Worth hype! I visited Barcelona, Monsant, Rioja Madrid past December craving tapas, Spanish charcuterie cheeses ever since. I particular food always skeptical places NYC- I'm always opinion restaurants survive even mediocre simply many people darn city inevitably full house even food/service great. Well serious neighborhood spot, hidden gem, worth positive reviews! Service welcoming polite, little wait grab drink bartender, transfer tab. The atmosphere cozy great romantic date night group birthday. They tv bar care that- I think playing futbol game, play Spanish pop music (Juanes, Bebe etc) softly, enough enjoyable loud obnoxious. It definitely worth making reservation (OpenTable) place popular date night, groups (3+ people way 15+ birthday outings). Even table ready right away, host/hostess get seated wait long they'll even bring complimentary Sangria. Now food! Tortilla Española excellent good-sized (we leftovers gladly took home breakfast), Albondigas (great , slow-simmered sauce), Gambas Al Ajillo  (Shrimp Garlic Sauce- could order two orders basket bread call day!), Grilled Sardines Red Pepper Toast- fresh, grilled perfectly!; Pan Tumaca (toast tomato, manchego, Jamon Serrano). Everything fresh, authentic tasted similar tapas I Spain. The thing I thrilled Pulpo Smoked Pimenton (octopus Spanish Paprika). It obviously kind can- pinch craving it, ok- texture unappetizing. If type likes authentic grilled, fresh Octopus (such type serve Greek/Mediterranean restaurants Spanish places; Pulpo la Plancha), it. This kind can, warmed up, tossed olive oil smoked paprika. Wasn't fan. In addition, Jamon croquetas disappointing, since staple item, busy Friday night. We wines glass half pitcher Sangria. The Sangria ok I wine purist like wine/liquor punches mimosas, friend enjoyed it. All all, prepared cozy, neighborhood spot popular, make reservation GO! There two large groups, least 10 people, time there, waitstaff able serve well regular tables problem. They work hard seem enjoy jobs, always water refills, etc, problem asking extra bread extra fork. Definitely recommend! 4.0 Such beautiful place! I came celebrate valentine's day perfect! The locations narrow space bit claustrophobic making drawback abt place. There easy way maneuver ppl. You move way cautious bump someone else so. With said I highly recommend making reservations avoid awkward dance ppl. Plus wants wait 15mins table become available?! Ok, first drinks! I regular glass sangria $7. Not delicious huge!!! My dilemma whether order half pitcher glass. The glass way! It strong, delicious.  By ordering half pitcher also try diff sangria flavors, like did. (I tropical sangria fruity I def prefer regular sangria). Just keep mind 1 glass sufficient deny wanting try many flavors?! The food!! Yum yum yum! My absolute favorite meatballs empanadas. The pollo al ajillo mmmmmm good. The mussels ok. This food reminded moms cooking! How could I give place 5 stars? With four plates enough two ppl. They also constantly refill bread basket nice bc able use taste sauce meatballs, chicken etc. The flamenco show suppose start 8:30 cherry top dinner. Unfortunately, bday going slightly blocked stage still able enjoy performance music meal. They even invited bday girl stage!! For place def list bday considerations!!! 5.0 Met girlfriend catch up, seen in, well, let's say, way long. I'm giving spot 3-stars based food, chill, sat hours unrushed service pretty good.  We shared tapas so-so unfortunately warrant return visit. However, need place tapas, pretty good service relaxed atmosphere East Village might good spot you. 3.0 I came Thursday night enjoy drinks Flamenco show.  Warning:  This review NOT food. We ordered pitcher blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria amazing.  If sangrias could good...It perfect balance sweetness, bubbles, kick alcohol, leaving best kind happy buzz.  The flamenco show unreal.  You could see passion performers' faces, includes dancers musicians.  I remember half way though show thinking thankful I live Manhattan without leaving city, I could feel like I teleported Spain hours.  You get sucked show forget New York! If want authentic, intimate experience, spot. 5.0 Made reservation online Wednesday 2/13 boyfriends birthday. After careful research yelp made reservation 8:00pm. Arrived 745' ish. We seated knew exactly were. (on reservation noted birthday called confirm reservation mentioned perhaps flan sent table.) amazing. The food!

It's worth it. In terms food drinks, variety sangria choices tapas ordered pretty good. There many tapas options almost overwhelming, good way. The service great! Jenny, server, incredibly welcoming attentive. I great night! 4.0 Can't beat east village food, place proves that. A authentic Spanish restaurant tapas I'd Madrid, done well. There flamenco dancing sat night, made great entertainment. This place wonderful dates chats close friends.

All tapas come large small sizes, I recommend ordering 6-7 (for party 3) small sizes, especially the: Churrasco Arriero - skirt steak sautéed garlic spicy cherry peppers Albondiguillas Estofadas - stewed meatballs brandy sauce Gambas Al Ajillo - grilled shrimp garlic sauce Almejas En Salsa Verde - clams parsley, wine garlic sauce I loved four dishes!! I also tried new oxtail item menu, realized oxtail me. I glad I tried though. Service outstanding friendly, I understand flamenco dancers nights.

Would I go back? I think so. 3.0 The first time I came I ordered oxtail. Something bf never before. I put on. It amazing experience I happy share him. I definitely consider new go-to tapas spot. The food seemed thought put quite ethnic. Lots variety servers nice. Try get high-seated tables, seems carry ambience well, instead low seating section tucked away back. 5.0 What wonderful place!  Cozy, comfortable low-key, tapas bar all.  The staff attentive actually happy there!  The food delicious: chorizo toast topped quail egg, stuffed peppers, skirt steak Seafood Payaya (their way) everything exceeded expectation.   I wait go back! 4.0 Fun Thursday night! Came around 8pm boyfriend's birthday treated live flamenco show. Food delicious blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria amazing. I called ahead see could bring dessert birthday celebration. INSTEAD, boyfriend I surprised live band called name mic birthday dance one flamenco dancers. Definitely recommend fun date night. 5.0 One best tapas places NY! Food amazing people working super friendly. My group went friend's birthday Saturday night. The Flamenco dance every Saturday made night lot fun engaging. They served us slice birthday cake free "allowed" bday friend dance front everyone. Will definitely come back. 5.0 If live visiting NYC: COME HERE! Make reservation Thursday Saturday 8:00 10:00. And prepare fantastically free flamenco show!! It amazing thoroughly entertaining, even make people celebrating birthdays get stomp away! I would strongly suggest bringing friend try amazing menu. But solo like request seat bar watch flurry sangrias possibly make friends bartender people sitting next you. This also great date spot looking romance someone passionate dancing tasty nibbles. 5.0 We went quiet dinner New Year Eve. We made reservation day before. We got nice seat window. The server polite. The food pretty good. We LOVE ox tail dish much. It MUST order! We small plates delicious. They came generous size reasonably priced. The spicy potatoes another one try. We variations before, one pretty good. We also blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. delicious. We definitely go back! 4.0 Tasty tapas complex flavor. Maybe better Spain, sayin 5.0 I need come back ASAP. My friends I came without reservations New Years Eve around 9pm (although I tried make reservation online, expected NYE, luck). We greeted David, incredibly nice hilarious! He said sure openings, spent several minutes check (I guess analyze restaurant crowd see anyone leaving). He came back, said wait 5 minutes, fantastic since I expected turned away! We staying whole night asked us, fervently assured weren't, enthusiastically asked us "why not? should!" ... another response I expecting (I thought going say 'good, we're booked got table next party comes' 'we're booked rest night' 'you can't table forever'). I believe waitress named Jenny, also charming helpful. Food delicious! I get seafood paella, friends got delicious fruity salad things I cannot recall... stayed good amount time leaving New Years Eve engagements, sad leave great find. But I'll definitely back (next time enjoy drinks)!! 5.0 Had delightful tapas dinner recent Sunday evening. The platter meats cheeses, simple chorizo dish, patatas, garlic shrimp well prepared. They forgot order octopus, plenty full harm, foul. We washed nice bottle rioja. We still engrossed conversation finished bottle, continued top us open bottle bar -- that's good service. 4.0 I came husband date night slightly disappointed. The ambiance good. Cozy welcoming. Kinda dark exposed brick walls. I liked it. What I impressed food; ordered pretty much everything menu,  because that's usually do. Lol I honestly say OCTOPUS WAS THE BEST!!!!!! Most tender juicy.  One find city. However, rest ok... blown away. Blend, much flavor,  greasy, etc. I would come back drinks octopus. Not entire dinner meal though. 3.0 My boyfriend I coming Nai years brother came town fiancé, brainer would taking them. We went Thursday saw amazing Flamenco dancers and, usual, food perfect. We ordered multiple pitchers Sangria (red, champagne, blueberry champagne) tastey other. Some best Sangria we've had. Our favorite dish usually fried goat cheese toast, patatas aioli, mussels. Can't wait go back soon. Hands favorite place city. 5.0 Is place real? Or I dream glorious dinner experience? Not really sure everything night experience AWESOME great price. Located East Village 1st 10th 11th, I passed Nai many times, never thought anything it. Nai came recommended friend Rachel perfect since craving two things: tapas sangria. Okay... Where I begin? Our waiter one attentive, friendly knowledgable people I ever encountered restaurant city. The service experienced throughout 3 1/2 hour meal Nai Tapas got thinking fantastic service become rare, gotten used mediocre service rushed restaurants next party seated. This case Nai. We enjoyed dinner warm welcome, continually told take time, thoroughly enjoy food drinks. And thank sir, that... On top 5 star service modest, authentic Spanish restaurant 1st Ave, offer happy hour 8PM. $20 pitchers sangria, 4 flavors choose from, important insanely delicious being: blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. Rachel I shared 2 pitchers throughout course night get enough. It probably best sangria I've since sitting beaches Spain, sweet, bubbly, fizzy, happy buzz champagne. (I brought another friend 3 days later happy hour). Nai offers long menu authentic Spanish tapas, ideal ordering bunch sharing. This mission within since wanted everything menu. Luckily us, waiter provided helpful tips, prepared, personal favorites. They start baguette olive oil, take time peruse menu. We ordered seven tapas throughout night, two three time, stagger flow meal enjoyed each, sipped sangria. Everything ordered fresh flavorful, transporting right back Spain night, four blocks NY apartment. What order: Fried goat cheese balls wrapped Serrano ham slice tomato toast. Amazing. ($6) Gambas Al Ajillo- Grilled shrimp garlic sauce. Garlicky, plump shrimp. ($6) Bacalao Frito- Chunks cod, lightly fried. Fresh, crispy, perfect squeeze lemon.

Wait staf helpful friendly. Tapas wonderfully tasty, especially oxtail. You love Nai 5.0 Really like place! They house-made sangrias, live flamenco entertainment thur/sat 8:30pm 10:30pm. The tapas recipes interesting, they're specifically Galician. Very cool! We make reservations, I strongly recommend do, nice tried best seat us. 5.0 Four us came last night enjoy late night flamenco show. Nai typical East Village underground establishment: quaint makes size create convivial environment. Exposed brick walls, sconces emit intimate, cave-like lighting, built arches depicting daily life Spanish señorita, overall authentic charm Tapas places hold key to. My friend made reservation 10 pm show (no cover charge(!), booked earlier time slot 8:30) I would definitely recommend proceeding reserving advance place gets packed tighter boquerones. For drinks, decided stick sangrias amazing. The regular version perfect balance sweetness one bite apple revealed fruit flavors replaced liquor splendor. We also went pitcher blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria absolutely delicious. I 2 glasses I definitely feeling effects quickly (though I'm sure drunken fruit something well). The show absolutely amazing. Willa Bronce, Romanian Gypsy gives solo performances, stunning. My eyes transfixed watched dig soles/soul dance floor, whipping hair around like whip clapping castanets vigor crab's claws. The music, hypnotic sultry, sensational makes quite passionate evening. My complaint I wish show longer set hour! Nevertheless, places like Nai make thankful I live city I could easily bask heat flamenco show without travel Spain. I'll definitely back Nai flamencho fire perhaps even tapas two. 4.0 Awesome, awesome drinks! good food. We tried least 10 dishes disappointed any. We also went Flamenco night enjoyed performance. 4.0 I lookout good tapas place NYC. So far I've underwhelmed. Everything alright far. Nai Tapas stepped notch. Could I mildly intoxicated DELICIOUS blueberry sangria? Probably. You're saying yourself: "Blueberry sangria? That can't be! Also, I hate blueberries, NO!" All I say back is: SHUT UP AND GET IT! My lady-friend like blueberries either (I know, I still her?) sangria. BLUEberry? More like HAPPYberry (Get it? You do). We selection different tapas accompany drinks: patatas bravas, chorizo, meatballs, cheeses host stuff I can't remember. The main take away: run, walk here. Stop everything currently doing. Facebook wait. Tell boss TPS reports coming late (and yes, remember cover page time). "But Jaime..." say (God, whiny today), "How's service?" When I say I wanted best friends wait staff, I mean it. They super friendly helpful. They also play great music made feel I back Spain. Bottom line? Do I really need write it? I mean, pretty certain places like Spain, city. I gave five stars spent 4 paragraphs (oh God, makes 5!) talking amazing is. Do favor stop reading. If still moving eyes follow words, idiot. STOP! Direct body towards Nai Tapas. Now. You thank later swigs sangria. 5.0 Made reservation past Tuesday 6 p.m. I arrived around 5:50 cousin diners around 6:30 (then started getting busy). We greeted seated promptly, server (forgot name) excellent throughout whole night. He came table quite times asking meal was, refilling water/alcohol, shared small conversation upcoming backpacking trip Europe. We ordered large everything (except asparagus). Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp garlic sauce), Mejillones Rías Baixas (mussels), Pintxo de Chistorra con Huevo de Codorniz (spicy chorizo/quail egg/manchego cheese toast), Chorizo Riojana (chorizo/potatoes/egg yolk), Rabo Guisado (braised oxtail- winner table), Esparragos Navarros (white asparagus- first time trying, like this. kinda mushy liking, taste. server inform us difference though white green asparagus), & Tabla de Quesos Embutidos (assorted cured meats/cheese). After ordering, server asked I've ever I ordered favorites/popular dishes. I said nope, Yelp brought here! So thank fellow Yelpers! EVERYTHING (except white asparagus) DELICIOUS! The bread basket give also perfect dipping sauces/delicious goodness. We also ordered pitcher Tropical Sangria, good. Maybe little fruity, taste much alcohol, could alcoholics training. I try sangrias next time. I really liked restaurant's food, I would come back again. The GREAT SERVICE received cherry top great dinner! 4.0 AMAZING.  Service, food, music... Can't recommend Nai Tapas Bar more! 5.0 The best spicy clams life. Almejas Diablo. Spicy, salty, savoury. Simply amazing. They ao delicious I wiped sauce bread. And I NEVER eat bread. Gambas al Ajillo - clams, second favorite. Perfectly cooked shrimp (hard come by) garlic olive oil sauce. Wine - great Sangria! The rest wine selection so-so 5.0 I took date Saturday night blast. We reservations, mistake, 45-minute wait. The host accommodating though, provided us bar stools sit waited. The waitress friendly attentive, food delicious, entertainment great--a festive appropriate atmosphere. Highly recommended. 5.0 Pomegranate sangria FTW! Service fantastic prices affordable. The paella however like rice dish traditional pan crunchy deliciosuness bottom, still good I different expectations. Mussels amazing! Did I mention pomegranate sangria? It MUST! 4.0 All dishes amazing. The best ess chorizo playfully pepper toast topped fried quail egg manchego. Highly recommend!! 4.0 Having heard great things tapas bar, friend I decided would catch wine tapas here. Alas, tapas compare lovely plates places like Casa Mono Boqueria. For sure, Nai nowhere near league aforementioned. Although dining room one table seated I arrived, I contributed early meeting time. Because, heading out, dining room near capacity. Maybe I taken empty tables sign I walked canceled reservation, I hate scrambling another dinner option last minute. Plus, what's harm trying new place? We opted pitcher blueberry-pomegranate champagne sangria. I appreciated fact quite options use red wine base. Not I like red wine, makes sleepy. The sangria overly sweet, slightly tart quite refreshing. And, since dining early, got entire pitcher happy hour prices ($20)! That's probably part dinner I enjoyed besides company. The waiter suggested 2-3 tapas per person, figured 5 would good number. Pan Tumaca - barely toasted bread barely drop tomato juice topped serrano ham manchego cheese. I known order I saw topped ham cheese. When I order pan tumaca, I really want garlicky tomatoes nicely toasted bread. What disappointment. Pulpo la Gallega - octopus paprika, olive oil salt. I looking forward grilled octopus, seemed boiled tossed paprika oil. It mushy texture pieces seemed oddly gel-like consistency. Gross! Bacalao Frito - basically fried fish nuggets served aioli. Nothing special batter crispy. Patatas Alioli - potatoes garlic alioli sauce. The potatoes crisp enough absorbed alioli sauce, made even soggier. Caracoles - escargot house sauce. I completely mind snails came really good garlic sauce. I would've liked toast soak sauciness. I made bread bread basket sopped sauce - shame! Maybe ordered wrong, I can't say I impressed dishes ordered. And even though I liked sangria, something would bring back place. I'm guessing people come price points low, I'd much rather pay enjoy food cheap bad dinner. Sorry Nai, I'm going say nay next time... 2.0 Came friends birthday dinner around 8:30/9 Wednesday. Let say, place tad hard locate (literally wandered block aimlessly good minute I looked OH! well...THERE IT IS!). The service AMAZING!!! Our waiter Unueo (prounounced UNO, like card game), gets A++ top notch recommendations, funny jokes, impeccable service. He attentive, paid extra attention tiny details birthday girl (ie: big ol' sangria glass extra fruit mini surprise, slice cake candles end dinner). This guy nothing short AWESOME! PROPS TO YOU SIR! Onto food...The sangria pitchers Mon-Wed $20 (they around 6 7 options choose flavor wise). We tried champagne sangria well mango flavored one. The mango sweet side champagne perfect me, sweet strong. For 3 girls, two pitchers enough! As tapas, two options: tapas regular size. We 6 tapas 2 regular sizes, lot originally decided order, somehow managed finish it! A favorites: Churrasco (skirt steak) - cooked perfectly side version chimichurri sauce(ask extra!) Mussels paprika sauce - sauce amazing!!! We allow take away sauce done mussels ate entire thing free bread soaked sauce, haha! Shrimp garlic sauce - We loved one too, friend kept saying "I cannot believe I dipped bread oil garlic sauce". It really THAT good! Oxtail - tender juicy! A recommendation def point enjoy oxtail much I do. A nice cozy spot I've heard type music show Fridays. Probably best avoid planning talk lot! 5.0 The good: -- free flamenco show Thursdays Saturdays 8pm 10pm -- delicious food -- amazing sangria choices -- good location trendy East Village The bad: -- get crowded flamenco shows -- forget conversation flamenco shows -- service average (a bit slow times) -- get expensive, expensive 4.0 This place lovely! The staff super friendly, helpful. coconut crepes stuffed shrimp: probably best thing ordered. anchovies served toast fresh minced garlic: reading Serious Eats review:  newyork.seriouseats.com/… decided order this. Neither us ever tried anchovies, may order again-I think we're anchovy fans. fried goat cheese slice tomato & toast wrapped imported Serrano ham: could good? Serrano ham croquettes: favorite stewed meatballs brandy sauce: again, Serious Eats raved good. The sauce delightful bread. 4.0 Whenever I someone visit town, I bring here. The staff great. Very friendly attentive. The menu amazing. Lots variety, fresh tasting, savory, expensive. They specials sangria (many kinds) large beer list. I've gone without reservation, takes second make one site. Even olive oil give free bread delicious, I loove olive oil. 5.0 5/5 stars me. What place! A definite must go Thursday night Saturday night. Bring date, bring friend, bring grandparent, bring stranger! 8:30 10:30 nights Flamenco dancing Reynoldo Rincon family (wife, son, daughter). They two shows everyone eating talking table electric. The traditional dancing, atmosphere, energy. Now, food! The waiter, Julio, huge help. As group 4 men suggested get 8 tapas. We selected 2 each. I go ranged octopus sardines serrano ham croquettes goat cheese stuffed olives. Julio upset two best sellers (shrimp garlic sauce churrasco quail egg), brought anyway.  UNREAL. We pitchers red sangria dinner traditional sherry. What experience. Don't think seafood place only, plenty non-seafood tapas try. Sit bar, get table, make reservation! Until next time. 5.0 3 food 5 atmosphere energy math still sharp - SOLID 4 stars Must get flamenco show Thursday Sunday.  They start 8:30 10:30 make sure book advance original comes (visited Madrid exactly same). 10 different tapas ABSOLUTE must order ostrich egg sausage tapa.  The churrasco also tender excellent.  I unfortunately cant remember others relatively good.  Finished meal couple light desserts (coconut flan chocolate cake), maybe lightest haha, can't go wrong them. Will certainly back! 4.0 I went Nai past Saturday I booked reservation 4...for Sunday - ouch!  The host (David) handled situation perfectly could ask for.  He discretely informed I booked wrong day embarass front party.  Then, gave option waiting see could find us space bar come back another time.  After 10 minutes, David get us space, got us full table.  The place packed I know it, pulled off. After phenomenal service David, continued server well.  He patient group took us little figure everything wanted order.  He knowledgeable menu asked, paced meal right. Amazingly, food good service!  We ordered 6 different dishes one better last.  The empanadas amazing!  When said done, bill came $130, extremely affordable 4 people including 2 large pitchers sangria. I never Yelp I incredible experience Nai, I felt need share.  I certainly back soon! 5.0 Great food. We large group blast. Pulpo la gallega favorite. 5.0 The food, atmosphere, drinks give place easy four stars. The service bumps five. The staff incredible job making out-of-town guests feel comfortable ordering tapas, extremely attentive drinks food. Love place! 5.0 So glad I found new favorite! I decided go dinner birthday last Friday birthday arrived group 10. The manager accommodating service great. A friend brought cupcakes dessert staff refrigerated ready charge additional cake fee. The food delicious, authentic. My favorite chicken croquettes I enjoyed everything ordered. There six flavors sangria sampled 4 6, really good! Since went Friday, I missed Flamenco show I back soon! 5.0 A breath fresh air aming overpriced tapas places city. Nai real tapas bar be. Good assortment tasty small plates, laid back atmosphere friendly waiters. The food ambiance reminded tapas bars Spain. It's refined anything, simple, flavorful artery clogging. Great place meet friends shoot breeze. Recommend chorizo rojo, gambas ajillo, manchego & jamon, setas last least giant pitcher sangria. 4.0 Wow! Number one tip place: Go Flamenco night request table dining area see flamenco show.  The flamenco show makes place 5 stars.  The food otherhand measly 1 (wah wah wah...).  I think favorite food olive oil came bread, flamenco service worth going for. My boyfriend took anniversary; amazing choice.  We reserved table second flamenco show night arrived extremely packed restaurant.  We reservations 10:15 get seated towards 10:45 11:00.  It kind crazy 'cause large party kick people accomodate made reservations show. I entirely happy 'cause got seated behind another table worked perfectly end.  Once music started, matter I restaurant. The guitarist spoke oceans emotion hands elegantly strummed guitar endlessly throughout night flamenco dancers casted feet beat music spun twisted bodies around stage vigor. Aside music/flamenco, ordered tapas Yelp reviewers said favorite ordered couple half pitches sangria.  The sangrias got good.  The servic slow waiter friendly nice I mind.  Plus,  really large party I understood.  We got octopus dish, meatballs empanadas (a seemingly safe choice) pretty terrible/over salted.  I could tell used good ingredients something went wrong kitchen, multiple times.  However, flamenco good really easy overlook bad food. I know next time order food here. In summary-- ultimate power play-- Have dinner beforehand someplace better food, come Nai Tapas Bar flamenco show orders lots lots drinks like Sangria experience flamenco friendly, awesome service. 4.0 This place fantastic. My friend I came last night tapas left happy (and mildly drunk brandy soaked apples consumed $20 sangria pitcher). The service excellent attentive hovering us every 2 minutes. Every dish delicious made quality ingredients. I believe also live flamenco music Thursdays Saturdays. I definitely return! 5.0 Amazing Tapas Restaurant East Village!! Been twice already cant wait go weekend. Made reservation flamenco saturday night show spectacular! Awesome food, goat cheese balls, crepe seafood ground beef pocket bites die for!! Service really friendly courteous!! Music show something else. Looking forward go again!! 5.0 Best sangria ever food amazing I love place service great plan ahead make reservations.  The flamenco show awesome tho guitarist kind freaky play A$$ off.  The food amazing except squid ink that's everything else great.  GO!!!!!! 5.0 Fun lively place! There 30-45 minute wait Saturday night bad. I would recommend making reservations plan ahead. My favorite items still blood sausage coconut flan. We also tried: Shrimp garlic sauce: The garlic sauce amazing. We dipped everything garlic sauce (our skirt steak, octopus, everything). The shrimp okay. Churrasco: The skirt steak pretty bland chewy. The dipping sauce tangy. Wouldn't order again. Octopus: After best grilled octopus Marea night before, I really disappointed bland boiled octopus here. Mussels paprika wine sauce: Very good! The mussels tender. Mango sangria: Very refreshing. Tasted like white wine hint mango. Even though waiter recommend 6 plates 2 people, already stuffed 5 plates! Next time going order 6 plates blood sausage leave extremely happy. 4.0 Came dinner group 8 friends. Food GREAT! Their tapas portions good size. I feel ripped like certain tapas places serve 2-3 bite size pieces plate charge $20 it. Out 8 dishes ordered, I definitely recommend chicken croquettes, patatas alioli, braised oxtail, chorizo toast quail egg manchego cheese, piquillo peppers stuffed salted cod. The skirt steak good, nothing i've never before. Their mussels paprika wine sauce decent...but actual mussel kinda small. We also berry pomegranate sangria mango sangria. They tasted great...especially pomegranate. All all, bill $34 per person. Great price, great food. The thing like loud flamenco performance, I lost voice talking music loud noise. Other that, restaurant definitely worth checking out. 4.0 My girlfriend I great experience Nai Tapas including tasty set small plate tapas Flamenco dancing!!  The staff friendly food delicious. We first started braised oxtail seafood croquettes.  Both dishes tremendous flavor provided good start great evening.  Then came meatballs, chorizo, patatas aioli dishes.  All three lived quality.  The beef empanadas came next.  A delicious classic course enjoyed. The next course calamari.  This probably least favorite dish evening.  We enjoy sauteed calamari lacked flavory taste previous dishes.  However, shrimp garlic skirt steak dishes made disappointment calamari.  Both dishes flavory taste satisfied appetite.  The tasty dishes also came complimentary entertainment flamenco dancing really created great atmosphere dining.  Overall, tremendous evening food entertainment! 4.0 I last night best friend's birthday, I cannot put words amazing restaurant is. For service, I would give 10 5 stars, food, I would give 9 5 stars. It's good!! Everybody -- especially Uno, I served times I'd visited -- super duper friendly caring, tell actually enjoy working (if not, they're insanely good hiding it). I brought homemade cake celebrate friend's birthday asked it'd okay us eat meal. At first I worried would frown upon it, contrary, Uno nice it, kept cake kitchen finished eating brought lit candle. He cut slices us even packed leftovers washed plate I brought! We left one slice Uno (with generous tip, course) token appreciation :) As food, get coconut crepes seafood filling. These SERIOUSLY change life also go great sangrias (my favorite tropical). Chorizo con cebollas also great, meatballs. I've already many many times, says lot I rarely ever go places I've before. Will DEFINITELY return soon. foodcomalogs.blogspot.co… foodcomalogs.blogspot.co… 5.0 i've definitely better tapas can't complain. could lot worse. early dinner empty! heard get crowded due flamenco dancing later evenings. i'd say little chorizos delicious 3.0 meat cheese platter -  the meat cheap pizza topping cheese like inner sole converse star bought bowery 1941 . rioja similar carlo rossi mixed chateau diana .. waitress asked us food good even arrived !!! place sucked . big time . hasta la vista . 1.0 Went last night girlfriends birthday. We live NJ decided needed night city going couple friends, I opted take here.  The food sangria unbelievable.  There little bit wait totally understandable Saturday night.  But bellied bar red sangria perfect.  When table ready waitress fantastic, suggesting shrimp based seafood tapas big sellers.  Everything prepared fresh delicious.  The icing cake, everything including tip 105.  Perfect night city. 5.0 We stopped heading dinner spot happy hour.  $5 glass sangria $10 half pitcher. We asked bartender order recommended blueberry champagne sangria indeed best sangria I ever .  She recommended four five tapas items ended mussels white wine sauce.  Must say scrumptious .   It felt like I Madrid again! We dipped bread sauce til gone. We definitely back again! 5.0 Nice food, great live flamenco music.  Get's crowded long waits limited seating right shows recommend showing earlier. 3.0 I came recommendation coworker couldn't/wouldn't stop raving place.  He's couple times time would show pics food friends ordered.  And I must say, pictures looked amazing. I came full expectations weeks back date night w bf.  I knew I coming night flamenco performance I counting food deliver. We ordered 5 dishes.  Only one outstanding... others edible, I suppose, one dish outright disgusting. The shrimp garlic sauce best I've tasted NYC.  Hands dish highlight dinner.  We also ordered blood sausage (i'm adventurous I trying get bf well).  The dish came two tiny baguette slices even tinier halved blood sausage smaller size ring finger (my fingers short thin).  It taste bad b/c I taste anything thing tiny!!  The potato paprika good.  And I recall fourth dish was, I vividly remember disgusting pepper stuffed salted cod.  On menu two ways stuff pepper served; salted cod cheese.  I thought server brought us one stuffed cheese instead cod ordered b/c stuffing creamy (liked instant mashed potatoes cheesy tasting).  He insisted cod, I take word cheese one.  Whatever was, I bring take another bite first bite.  My bf assumed baccala tasted like that.  Seeing I've never baccala, I attest taste thing stuffed inside peppers nasty.  Ugh.  And waitress said favorite dish, too!!  I felt cheated somewhat.  But nice service good.  Though I doubt we'll back again. Back Las Ramblas tapas!! 2.0 I absolutely love place! It cozy. The service unbelievable! And every single dish ever ordered awesome! 5.0 Years ago, search tapas bar flamenco, directed multiple times Xunta (yelp.com/biz/xunta-tapas…). Unfortunately closed got around it, Nai opened (literally) Xunta's place 2010. Two bits advice help enjoy time here: 1) Come flamenco night. 2) Come flamenco night. Nai flamenco shows Xunta: Thursdays Saturdays, 8:30pm 10:30pm. Tables empty JUST flamenco starts, point people swarm in. If reservation, best bet nights try snag table sets, around 10pm, service geared back parties leaving. Otherwise, want one unhappy masses huddling entrance, lining wall, staring gloomily merriment inside. Try somewhere else. We arrived early intent taking sweet time dinner drinks - good idea since service slower show. The red sangria pretty good! I like half pitcher option (tip: size regular pitcher Las Ramblas yelp.com/biz/las-ramblas…). They also 5 flavors (white, mango, etc.) sangria heathens. As food, racions (the next size tapa) oxtail pan tumaca arrived table promptly. The pan tumaca (a.k.a. pan con tomate) served slivers serrano ham great. The oxtail beautifully tender difficult eat since fell bone easily. Typical tapas, like patatas (bravas alioli) chorizo la plancha, skippable. The patatas good. The chorizo salty, I befuddled raw egg yolk placed top fully cooked bottom, fried egg snipped whites prior plating. ?? Our waittress also recommended new dessert - basically beignets blueberry goat cheese, absolutely lovely. At point horribly stuffed, looking excuses stay rest flamenco... ...which excellent. Holy vaca, duende!! Flamenco furious, passionate spectacle sexy dance, three dancers went out. You could really feel rapport guitarist. There birthday parties room everyone's amusement, birthday women + man called end impromptu flamenco lesson one dancers. It kind hokey, imagine makes Nai perfect place large groups. Everyone room great mood, flamenco really contributed positive energy. Maybe sangria helped tiiiiny bit. Last worthy note: Our waittress super amazing. Friendly, full recommendations knowledge menu... She appeared exactly wanted something, never hovered. On top fact Nai reasonably priced tapas bar great sangria really fun flamenco shows, awesome service really icing cake (or, alioli tortilla?). 4.0 Relaxing atmosphere, great service amazing food reasonable prices. By far best tapas I've date. Having visited Barcelona eating fair share tapas sangria I say truly makes feel like I'm back Barcelona. The croquetes de jamon MUST ! 5.0 Good Lord!  7 tapas, make reservation.  Always make one huge groups! Flamenco performance transported streets Barcelona dreams made Rioja Serrano Ham.  Casual homey.  Get inebriated culture myriad fruity sangrias.  Paella, Tortilla Espagnola, Croquetas de Jamon, Pulpo La Gallega, Gambas al Ajillo, Mejillones Rias Baixas- Winners table.  Bread flows like wine, get sauce on. Escargot little goopy I tasted garlic-but whatever. Empanadillas de Atun- Amazing.   Great Service, understood terrible muddled Spanish shrug like gringo.  The service rapid attentive. Beware- tell birthday, guess who's dancing Flamenco dancers....Do even lift? 4.0 Meh. It's right. I think best thing place GREAT groups. If looking decent place group dinner place go. We ordered bunch things menu, theyre pretty average. The thing pops weak Sangrias... weak... I reference next AA meeting. 2.0 Service - Good. Held reservation I told coming late. We still able get happy hour special clock hit 7. Mango Sangria - Light tasty. The waiter recommended mango blueberry sangria lightest sangrias. Still enough alcohol make us (not me) red. Esparragos Navarros - White asparagus pink sauce. It definitely tender bigger normal asparagus. However quite expensive - large 4 pieces. It's something would try novelty due price food ratio. Mejillones Avoa - Mussels paprika wine sauce. It bowl many small mussels opposed big ones. Sauce perfect mussels salty dipping bread in. Tasty pretty good deal small size ordered. Churrasco Arriero - Skirt steak. It came medium-well done. A little chewy still good flavorful. Not fan dipping sauce though - mango salsa? Didn't really go steak. Tabla De Quesos Y Embutidos - Assorted cheeses cured meat. It alright. Chorizo potatos - I forgot dish name listed here. The chorizo little diced potato pieces equally tasty. I want more! Overall pretty good food I would definitely come back another time check many menu items sangria flavors. 4.0 Great tapas place. Check pulpo la gallego, really good. Usually crowded. Service good well (nice staff). Good spot east village. 4.0 It great experience. The bartender fun talk with, said Zaragoza cool. She recommended great drinks. The waitresses cool tons fun with. The food ok. The environment wonderful! 4.0 I really like place, casual homey feel inside. My friends I seated table 8, near flamenco area (which I'll get later!). Decor service great, I complaints that. We tried mango sangria blueberry champagne sangria; great. Not heavy alcohol side, fruitiness definitely came through. The tapas great. Recommendations list chorizo la plancha, gambas al ajillo, albondiguillas estofadas, croquettes. All food pretty good, prepared order least 2 3 plates per person; tapas restaurant all. The real reason came Thursday flamenco. It lot fun watch, mesmerizing times great music. It's definitely experience normally get. All all, fun place go mood tapas, definitely one better tapas restaurants I've to. They traditional jamon iberico, however, something I always look tapas place, otherwise, certainly good, cheaper many tapas places there. 4.0 Enjoyed meal food 3.5 star waitress awesome I bump 4 stars We came tuesday happy hour. Their sangria truely delicious reviews suggested. Really liked red one mango sangria also good, bit light/sweet We got Churrasio Arriero steak served red peppers side. This one ok. The steak could bit tender Patatas Bravas: potatoes spicy ketchup. Good nothing special Croqutas De Jamon: Ham croquette. My favorite night. Delicious also got order mix seafood, forgot name, right Overall, pleasant experience. The waitress, African American lady,  was super sweet, nice professional. She made whole experience awesome. Will definitely back again. 4.0 Go tapas can't find another spot must tapas location extremely convenient. We ordered mango sangria underwhelmed. For food, croquetas de pollo, skirt steak, mussels avo sauce, patatas bravas. None bad nothing best close best rendition anything I've ever eaten. The avo sauce bread skirt steak probably highlights meal. I make better croquetas home patatas bravas near delicious old favorite, Mercat. The waitstaff mildly attentive NYC caliber. I reserved open table honored reservation. Nai marked no-show even though I showed exactly time. Open table resolved issue bummer I deal that. No 39+ restaurants I've reserved open table ever done I'm rounding Nai 3 stars. 3.0 I desperate need last-minute Friday night dinner reservation 9 people. I surprised see Nai still availability short notice, I went ahead made booking. Service: 5 Food 3.5 The service absolutely phenomenal! I called several times change reservation never gave hard time. Our waitress friendly, made great recommendations, checked us regularly. She encouraged us try different flavor sangria ($25 pitchers, yes pleasee), even offered replace end liking (which issue since delicious). The food great, get wrong. The meatballs bomb, assorted croquettes flavorful flaky, I definitely recommend skirt steak. The patatas bravas bit mealy (the potato chunks big get crispy), opt patatas alioli instead. However, nothing stood wow-ed particular. All fantastic experience. The layout seating cramped, ambiance warm friendly, I would certainly recommend place anyone planning larger group dinners. 4.0 This place reasonably priced tapas bar East Village draws crowds cheap sangria weekend flamenco dancing. Alas, missed flamenco. Our reservations early evening enjoy cheap sangria. I feel like must've ordered majority menu, one takeaway Pulpo la Gallega good. Super fork-tender, chewy, I think I've ever octopus good much esteemed restaurants. In fact, octopus would probably reason return Nai Tapas. The rest food pretty unmemorable, standard patatas bravas croquetas. The Mejillones Rías Baixas smallest, pitiful mussels I ever seen, came steeped fragrant garlic / white wine sauce. Much bread-dipping ensues. Anyways, affordable tapas restaurant decent food, I'm sure third glass sangria watching lively Flamenco performance 2 feet front damn good time. 3.0 Nai Tapas solid food terms quality, unfortunately re-affirms belief tapas restaurants idea 'tapas' never feed enough... When went, flamenco performance, perhaps missed key part Nai experience. That said, asked waiter recommendations consequently got thought 2-3 best dishes every major food category. The food tasty...but somehow, even 3 us, got small bite every dish came by. If want 'authentic' experience, perhaps flamenco, Nai might worth considering. If want filling, hearty meal though, perhaps consider somewhere else... 3.0 Excellent service food. My gf I went nice surprise. Great sangria tapas really good. 5.0 I blast place! I reserved open table friend's bachelorette party (4 ppl) 7 Sat night asked right front flamenco performance. Around 2pm day I received confirmation call reservation. Nice! So us know girls take get ready course late 20 min. (But I call around 6:30 let know running late...the person phone nice it) When got table already waiting us minute wasted seated. The portion plate small choose tapa size instead regular size, basically 3 pieces 6 pieces. Even tough makes bit harder split 4 ppl waitress, Jenn, awesome way would put one extra us. I'm expert authentic tapas food I enjoyed food. We kept sangria coming many glasses cheers raised. It loud that's expected kind place. So looking pour heart date please go somewhere else. The flamenco spectacular! I never seen one opportunity watch closely sensational. The rhythm passion coming dance vibrant want get dance them. Our super  amazing waitress secretly put request shout bride-to-be invited dance floor! She exhilarated whole restaurant cheering danced best highlight night! Overall, great service, great ppl, great food priceless good friend kissing goodbye single hood loud bang! 5.0 My friends I thoroughly enjoyed place. We reservation wait around 30 minutes. We arrived restaurant manager said table would ready 2 minutes. Just 2 minute mark up, 2 horribly snippy females strut door right past us look open table go "I see high top awaiting us!!!!!" walk right over. The manager extremely friendly apologized rudeness girls, offered us free pitcher sangria spot bar waited. We hurry fine us. The place pleasantly crowded good atmosphere (Friday night around 9pm). We trouble picking things menu cause everything seemed appetizing. We ended going garlic shrimp, chicken croquettes, beef empanadas, meatballs brandy sauce, patatas aoili. Everything amazing! We happy every single dish difficult pick favorite. Great staff atmosphere, good food! I'll definitely come back sometime. 4.0 Ever since I went Barcelona, I've search Spanish omelette good one I there. Nai Tapas close get! All tapas tried excellent. I really think can't go wrong anything order here. Not mention prices reasonable! I came group 3, ordered 5 6 tapas, salad, pitcher sangria, bill came $88! That's pretty freaking awesome ask me. The atmosphere also really nice cozy, felt like Spain. Bonus - Thursdays & Saturdays flamenco show really cool entertaining watch. Also, friends birthday, bring birthday people stage area give quick flamenco lesson - awesome! 5.0 cant stop coming tapas bar! certified best meatballs i've ever life! sangria awesome! watered strong...great date night place entertainment! 5.0 I wish I impressed food I service.

We arrived 6:30 pm, seated right away even though still waiting one person arrive. Our waiter charming great marketing skills. We ordered pitcher mango sangria. This first time trying mango sangria, know expect. But waiter gave big go ahead it. The drink good, something would drink regular basis, warm weather refreshing.We ordered 6-7 tapas dishes. Being fish lover, really enjoyed Sardines. They fresh cooked right amount. Patatas Bravas, Chicken Croquetes, Seafood Paella, Oxtail dishes ordered. I try oxtail, friends really enjoyed it. The dishes ok, edible delicious . I lil dissapointed paella. I imagined paella barcelona trip lot fo shrimps, muscles, squids clams. But 17 bucks, portion really really small, literally 3 pieces seafood 4 spoons rice. Since waitor kept asking us everything was, gave honest review paella. He took review well, promised pass comment chef even gave us small discount paella. We ended meal coconut Flan. I liked it. 3.0 Nai Tapas awesome.  Great service, wonderful food, totally priced affordable, great sangria.  Do need anything else?  The reason I'm giving 5-star rating I think Alta Casa Mono better, value perspective, place rocks!  I highly recommend establishment - sure book reservations advance place usually sells out. 4.0 I've lot fun place.

You disappointed. 5.0 I really understand place gotten many good reviews open table, I originally found place. Our waiter rushed us meal moment sat down. Mussels good- half open rest un-fresh tasted bad. The "spicy broth" oily. When I told waiter mussels tried send back took dish walked away. We charged them... Egg omelette bland.

Yes, I tipsy awesomely cheap sangria deal. Yes, I PUMPED olives stuffed anchovies-- literally, that's I snacked I Spain Basque Country years ago. Excitement ended olives. The octopus, came highly recommended waiter, overcooked, mushy, badly seasoned. Also unimpressed fish dishes (all overcooked) asparagus (mushy too). Everything else mediocre. The service awesome take couple items bill disappointed. But still, tapas places popping Manhattan I'd really come back sangria flamenco... 2.0 Went Nai birthday 13 people. They could accommodating, responsive helpful. The experience well beyond expectations I definitely back. In fact, I bet 12 guests go back own. The Flamenco cheesy, might think.

And FREE dinner! - Try 'Gambas Al Ajillo' - shrimp garlic sauce tapas menu. - The host waiter INCREDIBLY sweet helpful menu explaining intracacies dishes. The Bad: - Very disappointing food! - I enjoy garlic potato dish - doused mayonnaise tuna empandillas, however, I try enough menu The Details: This place VERY loud come Flamenco dancing (9 - 10 PM Saturdays least) sit back want conversation. But that's Flamenco - heel stomping incredibly loud. 4.0 Great food, especially croquetas! Fast good service. Good value money. Lively atmosphere, although bit loud planning talking company entire time. Only thing I'm annoyed restaurant told Open Table I honour reservation, party I obviously did. 4.0 No one door accommodate new customers. We wait wait someone acknowledge us. The waitress explained menu us basically whole menu good. Anyways got Pan tumaca like bread toast topped serrano ham & manchego cheese. : turn I expected be, work one another especially cheese. Beef empanadas, called turnover: I always call safe side whenever I come Spanish restaurant. The meatballs: must case tapas good. Pulpo A La Gallega octopus sprinkled sea salt sweet paprika. This dish salty. Pollo Al Ajillo chicken potatoes garlic sauce. The chicken dry. I also tried mango sangria. Next time I go exploring sangria. Red sangria always way go. Service fluent. 3.0 Truly awesome brunch experience.  Beautiful paintings, great latin music, awesome sangria (multiple choices), great food, excellent service.  I must admin one 3 tables time, I can't speak service busy.  But great experience around.

I would definitely recommend! 5.0 Great service great food! :) 5.0 We tried go dinner show, early seating (8:00PM) full.  Instead went 10:00 PM Flamenco show Saturday.  Having come big dinner, order meal.  However, soon regretted full entrees around us (and reaction patrons food) looked great.   The show fantastic music dancing terrific.  I wish sound system bit better.  We literally front musicians sometimes hard hear vocals acoustic guitars.  That said, great show; passionate dancing music. The service polite efficient.  We literally ordered club soda coffee, waiter smiles attentive.  The check $6.00, cover, tipped $20.00 top taken table whole show. We definitely back eat dinner 5.0 Happy hour 7pm!!! :) We got half pitcher Sangria 10 dollars.. Their popular sangria red sangria..

Cheap & Delicious + friendly waiter + good & cheap sangria!! I return again! 4.0 This place great. The food really good. We got 4 tapas 2 people. The tapas come together one one. I know purpose, improved experience lot. I guess works sharing tapas. If sharing, might end eating different times. We got following: Gambas En Salsa Verde: delicious good size. Croquetas De Bacalao: tasty, somehow small. Only 3 little pieces. Patatas Bravas: Good amount potatoes. Pulpo A La Gallega: Nice ending great dinner. Along food, get (unlimited?) amount bread olive oil. The waiter tried convince us order one tapa beginning, 4 tapas + half pitcher sangria (with red wine) perfect amount food. At least us two. Service also really good. An top this, go say Saturday around 8.30 10.30, get flamenco show. Pretty entertaining. I go birthday, unless prepared dance flamenco. The place little pricey, taking account get show good food, worth experience. I'm glad girlfriend took here, hehe. 5.0 Been place twice keeps wanting more. The mussels, anything chorizo, croquetas delicious. Service always pretty good beer selection expected Spanish place (Estrella). Only Sangria happy hour (pitcher seemed watered downed). I must come Thursday Saturday - I believe flamenco dancing. 4.0 My friend visiting SF wanted tapas - though I've never Nai, I made reservations glad I chose place. Though I need reservation (the place pretty empty Tuesday night 7 pm), I've turned away weekend before, I want repeat that.

The sangria also really good, lot different types (we tried all) I think favorite still classic red sangria. The bartender really friendly helpful - made bunch suggestions pushy all. I'll definitely come back I'm mood tapas again! 4.0 Atmosphere 3.5 Decor 3.5 Food 3.5 Service 4 So I wanted get Tapas, place I could make last minute reservations for. I arrived dinner 10 minutes late reservation, friend already there. They seat yet, whole party seat (I understand that, that's pretty normal). But I arrived, one came help us out, someone came, helped couple walked right past us 8:45 reservation, server walked away...we waited whole 15 minute someone came seated us. After seated, service got much better. The servers really helpful answering questions, helping us make selections. Further more, phone batteries, friend charger, asked could charge phone. They really friendly it, looked free outlet without fuss :) The decor place quite cute. Very rustic wooden tables. Beware though, wooden tables (at least mine) sloped downwards, first, eating utensils rolled napkin rolled floor, I picked up, put table get utensils I put napkin lap, fork knife fell floor -- embarrassing. There great selection tapas, someone limited. A lot seafood, little meat. We ordered churrizo, garlic shrimp meant good, octopus, asparagus stuffed anchovies meatballs brandy sauce. All all, food average. It tasted good, food well seasoned, nothing really wowed me, left wanting more. The sangria great though, red sangria. I like sangria lot fruits, one slices apple. As summary, place OK . Probably solid 3.5. I would able give 4 though. 3.0 Came reading Yelpers reviews. It Friday night, friend used Open Table make reservation. Got end Happy Hour (Pitcher Sangria special). Haven't seen friend while, started chit-chat. The waiter came three times confirmed reservation, asked us we're ready order. So finally gotten order menu, quite big selection. We ordered 4 tapas dishes try, waiter said get one dish full. Taste wise okay, special. The skirt steak came bit tough, octopus tender yet kind bland. My friend liked Proscuitto wrap goat cheese ball lot, filling taste though. Price wise, expected East Village restaurants. 3.0 Love, Love, Love, restaurant! The food amazing wait staff equally wonderful.  We number times never bad experience.  Their garlic shrimp perfectly cooked tasty.  Their ham cheese croquettes one favorite things eat here.  The flamenco shows awesome.  Oh, drinks priced well tasty pack punch.  Can't wait go back! 5.0 Very good authentic tapas served cool relaxed atmosphere.  Prices reasonable drink selection solid, spanish beers ive never tried commendable sangria served three barrels set behind bar. A gimmick, yes, nice touch works.  Nice wine selection well.  All told, nice place go date friends day week. 4.0 They losing star due fact even though booked, still waited 45min table. I new NYC maybe normal? Other that, table, amazing! The waitress great job recommending food items delicious. As sparlking white wine Sangria, I words. The staff really friendly place buzzing, cozy atmosphere. I definitely recommend it...I craving Tapas writing review! 4.0 Nice selection, great service tasty food. Can't complain! Chorizo anything rocks. I can't wait go back again! 5.0 This might new favorite tapas place. The garlic shrimp, white asparagus, mussels delicious I get enough mango sangria. But I like goat cheese ham - goat cheese tasty itself, need deep fried. The flamenco dancers musicians really talented fun watch. I liked would grab everyone's attention watch dancers play quietly people could converse. The atmosphere intimate bring date! 4.0 The waitress patient willing educate us cuisine know much about. She seemed genuinely interested making sure good experience. The "house red" special happy hour good value. Would happily return. There tapas left try. 4.0 Absolutely wonderful! Great bottle wine! Amazing Tapas! We had: Salteado de gambas, Mejillones rellenos, Pelotollas de queso de cabra, Esparragos rellenos, Churrasco arriero, Solomillo la naranja! All delightful! Service great!! 5.0 I came birthday. The tapas pretty good waitress helpful picking tapas try well. We patatas bravas, beef empanadas, Chorizo A La Plancha, Tabla De Jamon Y Queso, Croquetas De Pollo. We also pitcher mango sangria go along it. All good They also added chocolate cake candle birthday! Great Service! 5.0 I spent 6 months Barcelona college, ever since craved tapas sangria dangerous extent.  Dangerous usually tapas United States way resemble anything I ate Spain, meanwhile cost 1.5-2 times much should.   Thankfully, Nai Tapas authentic affordable, I eternally grateful friend Aron choosing place birthday dinner.  The table got multiple pitchers sangria, classic mango flavors die for.  The pomegranate blueberry pretty good too, others overshadowed it.  Also, sangria actually packs punch fruit ice, beware!   I would recommend pairing someone table similar tastes, want passing plates entire table, easier split bunch stuff.  As  my boyfriend I, wanted authentic, weird-sounding tapas Catalan experience.   So.  We got escargot garlic sauce, blood sausage, ración (big order) patatas bravas, octopus, olives stuffed anchovies.  The escargot delectable (I mean garlic oil??), blood sausage amazing; great flavor presentation, patatas bravas authentic crispy, really brought back drinking Estrella Damm middle day eating Plaça Reial.  The olives good, I remembered, I'll give pass next time.  Really crowning jewel tender, flavorful pulpo la gallega.  There faking dish; octopus fresh, terribly obvious sauce stuff cover up.  Our waiter informed us dish good imported Spanish, cold-water octopus, opposed South Pacific octopus.  Kudos Nai right.   I can't wait come back try croquetas tortilla!   We also enjoyed flamenco performance, surprisingly authentic well.  The thing made conversation difficult since pretty loud, I complaining. 5.0 Came merienda sorts, Sunday afternoon (around 4:00). GREAT SERVICE, I think still case, even we're patrons restaurant. The food absolutely amazing. We ordered bacalao, piquillo peppers stuffed salted cod, fried goat cheese prosciutto toast calamari ink, everything tasted perfection! The flavor rich overbearing (as case tapas), quantity great (we ordered 7 people), texture everything right! We also ordered pitchers blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria, I definitely recommend. No complaints here! Will definitely return! 5.0 They six types sangria!  The blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria delicious refreshing.  The chorizo la rioja pan tumaca great.  The tortilla espanola stuffed peppers done well, bland.  The pulpo la gallega decent.  Service warm friendly. I go back try sangria flavors tapas menu. 4.0 The quality food declined since last visit. The octopus soft mushy. The spanish omelet overcooked I even finish dry. The potatoes aioli good. The dishes I memorable. And skip chocolate cake. The wine-soaked pear good, nothing special. Sucks I find new go-to tapas place consistent quality. 3.0 The tapas okay, would much better minor changes. I thought patatas bravas soft crispier. The Pan Tumaca would much better withOUT spicy tomato paste spread buttered toasted bread. The Churrasco Arriero - skirt steak best Gambas Al Ajillo bad. However, sangria watered down. On another note, came Thursday evening ridiculously loud live performers dancers. We seated near front see performers heard lots 'clacking' dancers' finger cymbals. They also appeared understaffed, one waiter 2 bus boys service really slow. 3.0 Yummyyyy tapas!! 4 people - 9 tapas dishes. Happy hour 5-7, $20 pitchers sangria. Who could ask anything else? Mussels - They succulent moist. The broth mussels cooked intense briney flavor. Typically I'm fan mussels cooked way I would order 2 servings it. I actually ended taking mussels putting bread dipping broth. Definitely something I would order next time I visit. Escargot - There 6 pieces snail garlic sauce escargot cooked - absolutely divine. If embarrassing I would totally licked garlic plate. Pairing garlic bread definitely made worth it. Definitely something I would order well. Ham croquettes - It's like higher level mozzarella sticks...but even better. There much ham inside croquettes hot melty delicious can't help go second piece. That cheese good. Goat cheese serrano ham, tomato toast - This definitely prettiest tapas plate whole evening. I'm fan goat cheese combination ham, toast tomato helped cut goat cheese flavor. Not fan goat cheese definitely tapas dish try first time. Chorizo onions - Who love chorizo? This dish better chorizo fried potato there's it. The carmalized onions cut salty spiciness chorizo sweet greasy onion taste. I also paired basket bread chorizo perfect. Definitely another dish order next visit. Chorizo fried potato - This tapas dish comes four pieces. Even though fried potato well starch base oily chorizo lot flavor bursting it. This something pass - something person home make own. Patatas Bravas - It fried potato squares spicy drizzle. Every tapas place - worth ordering? Probably not. I would like order another patatas dish though since starchy element (it also helps fill stomachs). Shrimp garlic sauce - One best dishes night. They gave us around 5-6 pieces shrimp garlic sauce mouth watering. It right amount garlic undertones broth hits seafood notes elevates little bowl. This paired bread also winner. Definitely definitely reorder! Meatballs - Meh. Meatballs meatballs. My friend commented Ikea meatballs better. They awful I would order another tapas plate anytime. For sangria, ordered mango blueberry. The mango sangria reminded one V8 tropical juices spiked wine. It vaguely sweet touch bite (probably lemon slices kept mistaking orange). The blueberry sangria stronger actually really taste like blueberries. It definitely hints sparkling wine I kept feeling fizz (probably buzz). We opted order dessert since Venieros across street. Our waiter great - hilarious picking us entire night. We ton fun sassy eachother. He gave us little jar Hot Mama's Belize pepper jelly like little jar crack. Just tried today fried chicken delicious. (I'm actually going hunt bigger jar smother fried chicken I find world.) I've never fan tapas since never seem fill also 3 baskets bread fill us total ended around $35 sangria great. I definitely would love come back try tapas dishes. FYI - there's 1 bathroom back. ~happy eatings! 5.0 Spaniard style food incredible Newark, often hard find good place tri-state area. This place blew away. The tapas absolutely fantastic. I one everything menu (having gone two nights back back I able try everything). For desert, I highly recommend flan de coco. It, honestly, best flan I ever life, I could eat flan every day, I would (i love much!). If can, definitely reserve table Flamenco performances. It beautiful made experience was. The bartender amazing!! She encouraged us come back next night watch Flamenco dancing. If can, sit bar! I usually hate sitting bars, bar soo much fun hang b/c bartender. She best!! 5.0 Great place. Very friendly. Good tapas. Good wine. Great performance flamenco. Awesome music. I didnt want leave! :) 5.0 So fun! We arrived 6:30pm Saturday night place packed. We managed find seats bar service great. I'm huge fan tapas recently Barcelona, I high expectations. Nai met pretty well! Really large selection dishes get tapas raciones. The night topped impressive flamenco performance talented passionate dancers. Seems like would great place celebrate birthday - dancers brought people special occasion taught flamenco steps. 4.0 Cute restaurant filled college aged diners. Food good exceptional. Sangria weak. While I great night, I dont think I would go way come here. 3.0 It's like 4.5 stars food sometimes lacking sangrias miss certain pezaz.   Overall atmosphere fun - especially flamenco nights!  The crowd happy waitstaff good job.  The food overall delicious - especially seafood - SO MUCH YUM!   The tapas little pricey - that's really biggest gripe. But hey - nice location east village need upkeep.   I brought many people here, still talk great place is! 5.0 A fun restaurant, great place go group friends. Delicious Sangria wonderful flamenco performance. Its great place hang fun. The server brought us another 1/2 pitcher sangria free paid encourage us stay rest set. Overall, service slow. Not place get quick bite. It Spanish restaurant all. 4.0 Food great service friendly. Prices definitely fair Sangria awesome. Especially berry champagne flavor. But weekend nights get packed small space. Even reservation hard get seated - could better job organizing reservations. But happy sit bar reservation work out. Nice spot! 4.0 I amazing time, waiter made possible, delightful food recommendations amazing!!!!!! negative thing say  the person first greeted me, friendly first worked end must definately go back 5.0 - 4.0 Love, love, love place.  The authentic tapas place find NYC.  The tapas actually things would eat Spain, part.  Some things better others.  Don't miss albondigas brandy sauce.  They incredible. Native speakers work there, native chef, etc.  I love tapas/racion portions like Spain, too.  Prices fair.   A must try! 5.0 I came Nai Tapas Bar group 20 around 7:15 p.m. Saturday. Despite potential intimidation numbers prime dinner time, certainly show Nai staff. They accommodating knowledgeable, food came timely fashion. The small/large plate option great way try number different dishes reasonable price, great sharing. Highlights included Almejas Diablo (clams spicy sauce), Caracoles (escargot , already taken shell), Patatas Bravas (potatoes house sauce) octopus, rubbery like one may usually think comes octopus. Be sure save bread use sauces. Two fairly minor nit-pickings grand scheme things deny 5-star rating me. While live music dancing quite entertaining energetic, also bit loud, tough conversation anyone table sitting close it. Also, staff would combine two small orders one large order, since large group, got confusing know else ordered dish -- could someone 10 people line end table, sides clueless. If smaller group, combining two small orders would convenient no-brainer. All all, I'd go again, sure, I definitely recommend it. 4.0 Croquettes mostly cheese -- can't tase jamon (and nice jamon either) Meatballs taste like spaghetti marinara Not I'd expect tapas bar The spicy papas bravas bland crisped well Possible I ordered wrong things, many options person can't eat seafood. I imagine going enjoying trying things maybe one two friends, big group service slow. Took hour get beer. 2.0 I rarely venture East Village, I would've never known place even existed friend suggested go check out. The inside pretty casual nothing special terms decor, packed clearly one neighborhood hot spots. From minute sat waiter (Uniquo I believe), amazing. We know wanted allowed choose 6 tapas plates us, made perfect selections. I still know good :) We also ordered pitcher champagne sangria, delicious packed good punch. By end pitcher I felt like gotten money's worth.  It waiter great. Every waiter busser made rounds would check tables around make sure one needed anything, I loved. I would say probably best date spot VERY loud. It's one restaurants cramp lots tables together fit many people possible, sitting neighbors' conversations (and pretty much laps), loud can't hear they're saying anyway. I barely heard friend saying across table. I would say based excellent food exceptional service alone, I definitely make trip back Nai future. 4.0 My three friends I arrived Friday night 6:45 reservation restaurant surprisingly still fairly empty. By time left around 8pm, place pretty filled... come early 1) get seats, 2) get happy hour drink special (a pitcher sangria $20) 7pm! Having eaten late lunch afternoon dessert, hungry ordered six tapas plates four us. We ordered: - Croquetas De Jamón (ham croquettes) - seemed way cheese ham... maybe one piece I took :-/ - Gambas Al Ajillo (garlic shrimp) - tapas portion came 7 pieces shrimp, flavorful one favorites - Calamari ink - pretty bland.. big fan - Caracoles (escargot) - buttery yummy, favorite night - Patatas Bravas - fried potatoes drizzled sauce resembled spicy mayo - Pulpo A La Gallega (octopus) - also bit bland side We also got pitcher blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria, VERY light delicious. It tasted like fruity soda... kind drink! Food drinks aside, service attentive excellent. We seated minutes end happy hour (7pm) waiter get around giving us menus 7, let us order happy hour drinks menu anyway. My friend also bought slice cake wanted take home, let store fridge end dinner. 5 stars service! Overall, good place go small group people, I'd definitely return sangria happy hour! 4.0 Best kept secret! My new favorite tapas bar. - Mussels paprika: large serving deliciousness - Hangar steak: tender cooked well. Even small portion nicely sized! - Coquettes ham: solid croquette. Not good Spain, it'll suffice I usually order - Escargot: AMAZING! I really know expect since I escargot Spain snails perfect size sauce amazing! - Chorizo onions: Good Pitchers sangria $20 happy hour. (I prefer red) Can't beat that. Love place! 5.0 Get Chase: Pros: 1) First thing I say ABSOLUTELY AMAZING service (very friendly, courteous, apologetic got crowded service slowed bit) 2) Food decent (Not spectacular, pretty good) 3) Not pricey $50 per person includes (10 large dishes + sangria pitcher + tip split 6 people) 4) Fantastic live Flamenco + spanish guitar weekends 5) Sing happy birthday 6) Lively, boisterous, fun atmosphere 7) A gem hit miss neighborhood Cons: 1) Food mind-blowing anything new 2) Definitely need reservations weekend waiting 4.0 A fun little restaurant great live flamenco performances certain nights. It get crowded reservations recommended, three us eventually able sit bar bit wait. The bartenders kind helpful. Start Moritz, sweet malty beer Barcelona. It packs lot flavor Estrella, another Spanish beer. Unfortunately, tapas good restaurants I went Barcelona. Not I expect exact quality, decent amount prices lot higher too. The patatas bravas supposed crispy creamy aoili spicy red sauce. Instead, soft, soggy, covered tasted like ketchup. They unfortunately simple pan con tomate (bread crushed fresh tomatoes). The pan tumaca (bread tomato, serrano, machego) good, really small bite. I would recommend squid ink mopping sauce bread probably favorite part meal. The Spanish omelette stuffed potatoes onions quite filling good pick hard get full small tapas plates. In end, $30 beer walked away stuffed. Not great tapas meal, worth try really mood. It least atmosphere good place bring date. 3.0 So apparently place Spanish people go traditional Spanish tapas...or I told.  I guess makes sense, walked tried order, everything already night - waiter shook head said "there lot Spanish tonight".  He may said "Spaniards", suspect mind changed "Spaniards" I fear mind little racist without knowledge, case "Spaniards" derogatory term, I'll assume say it. Now that's way.  The best thing place? atmosphere ADORABLE.  If care food quality, fantastic date place. Amazing. walk in, initially become skeptical "garden level" which, know, means "basement".  Gross.  However, room opens brick-facade-d, dimly-lit, soft orange/red glowing cozy little nook restaurant.  Insta-romance, folks.  The place guy says "i want make gal think I'm little bit romantic little bit fun, wrapped coating laid-back." The food able get hands (as everything out) meager order blood sausage (too dry chewy otherwise OK) greasy dish octopus pieces.  Sadly, octopus chunks covered fat greasy get good grasp long enough travel mouth, left hungry disappointed. However, sangria delicious, service great (friendly Spanish man pop occasionally least expected it), vibe perfect.  Will go back? Sure. sit bar drink friends. 2.0 Went girlfriend waited bit. Place small crowded, staff friendly food drinks good. We sat bar bartender nice attentive. They huge glass jugs/kegs sangria different types. Other drink selections well diversified. Tapas good, though I forgot ones ordered since pretty much got one each. No complaints here. 4.0 If looking tapas bar chill friends, Nais Tapas Bar place at. It's definitely amazing intimate tapas bar that's must go area. Each dish packed flavored sangria measures same! This good place celebrate occasion. The staff amazingly friendly & great suggestions. Everything also decently priced, plus love eating without breaking bank! 4.0 Had great time birthday party 9 ppl. The owner professional super easygoing, friendly guy makes special day special be. I came flamenco night made reservation 2 weeks before. What surprising I reservation confirmed day OF, via nice phone call restaurant. The tapas great. I number potato tapas, well-flavored - I highly recommend garlic potato tapas. I like octopus dish much white asapagus dish quite bland. Also, I get dish clams came 4 baby clams, sauce quite yummy. The live flamenco band dancers nice touch entertaining watch. Oh, surprise birthday girl... oh yes, surprise.... OMG I forget MANGO SANGRIA! SO DELICIOUS! Probably best sangria townnn. Get pitcher, heck get two pitchers!! Every gulp savory good gave perfect amount buzz. 4.0 Ate: Gambas, Cod wrapped potato, pork loin, chorizo Drank: Sangria Liked: Gambas good.  Cute space authentic. Disliked: Music loud trying talk.  Not fault, speed. Sangria weak. Chicken: None!  Chicken haters would love place! Would mom like it?:  Mom would go try dance embarrassment. Would I go back: Yes, night without live music. Recommend: Gambas Al Ajillo.  That's like calamri Tapas places.  And I love it. 3.0 Seriously, great place! Went birthday last night amazing meal. My roommate woke morning thinks dreamt gambas con ajo. Staff super nice too. We 8:45 reservation clearly call say we'd running late. We wait maybe 15-20 minutes table that, food WELL worth wait. Every single dish got amazing. The mussels divine, get TON. Definitely go papas bravas shrimp garlic. Both excellent good judges great tapas place! Escargot also die for. We also got peppers stuffed cheese salad, solid dishes. The bread good, olive top notch, really attentive staff. Also, really good/strong sangria! You taste brandy fruit like shot piece. Now I see bill, perks birthday girl, friends assured I bankrupt them! I can't wait go back definitely want check Thursday Saturday free flamenco show! I'd make reservation planning going weekend 9:30, packed showed 9:15 steady stream people. 5.0 A great place music dinner. The sangria excellent. The tapas though, hit miss, I would ask waiter recommendation next time. 5.0 The ambiance great, food tasty, service excellent.  We tried fried goat cheese toast, patatas braves, albondigas, gambas al ajillo, sliced steak, chorizo wrapped witth potato.  All choices delicious.  We ended meal coconut flan. We went Thursday evening enjoyed flamenco show ate great music.  It reminded Spain. Our server, Unua, accommodating friendly.   We definitely back! 5.0 Get blueberry pomegranate sangria, octopus fried goat cheese. 4.0 Food great, twice. The Mussels excellent great sauce dipping bread. Skip sangria...I've better. 4.0 Very good. Dan owner super friendly.  Thought great group patrons. Eclectic mix people. Not loud could carry conversation wanted. We tried huge array tapas. Only one care owner took bill despite us telling necessary. I'll back. 4.0 5 stars amazing staff good food!

After finished meal pressure us leave really nice friend visiting town great catch up. Also get sangria, regret it! 5.0 I impressed Nai. Their tapas selection great, making hard choose. I tried 7 different tapas, good, favorites following: Fried goat cheese- Awesome goat cheese balls wrapped jamon served tomato toast cracker. Pure awesome. It works incredibly well. Chorizo riojana- Think patatas bravas chunks chorizo mixed in. Whether potato sausage, every bite made happy. Meatballs (albondiguillas estofadas)- Tasty savory. These came delicious sauce I dip bread in. Seriously, prepare soak up! The staff great.  The manager came times check table, see things going. He super friendly even gave us complementary shots dessert liquor!  Which I need- I sufficiently buzzed mango sangria.  Watch out, may taste like fruit juice must lot alcohol masked it. The tropical sangria also good mango tad better. There also live flamenco shows twice week. I'd love check out! 5.0 Great service, particular Jenny behind bar. Took recommendations reviews, shrimp garlic potatoes aioli really tasty. We finished meatballs pretty good well. All all, relaxing enjoyable experience Sunday night. 4.0 Great tapas place right near I live. Everything ordered great except dessert.   We especially loved skirt steak ordered second round!  Make sure book reservation ahead time Fri Sat dinner otherwise gets quite packed!  Will def come back! 5.0 I usually like tapas places they're way expensive worth it. This exception. Came buddy talk business, asked waiter give us selection favorites. The guy awesome, super friendly, really fast service, extremely considerate. Turns tapas REALLY freakin' good! We ordered another round choice, also fantastic. Sadly I remember were, I would totally bring friends they're mood little tapas action! 4.0 Went friend's birthday dinner.  They good wine list including 4 different kinds sangria - white, red, champagne, blueberry pomegranate champagne.  There also extensive tapas menu, come bigger servings too.  For four people ordered 6 tapas - along bread give - perfect amount food.  The food delicious, favorites fried goat cheese, potatoes garlic alioli, skirt steak. For six plates tapas two pitchers sangria paid $30 something, including tip - must inexpensive expecting! Plan going back soon! 4.0 If I reviewed Nai Tapas beginning first plates came out, would gotten 5. While food delicious, service started great, I left incredibly disappointed. After plates came out, server bother come check us all. Apparently, group next us much important friend I, since constantly. We wanted desert, one bothered glance us. We wave someone bill. It tempting leave unnoticed. Both friend I foodies pay whatever takes great meal (we paid $200 WD-50 night before). We highly value customer service therefore tip generously.

Pulpo A La Gallega (spanish octopus virgin olive oil, sprinkled sea salt sweet paprika) - The octopus little squishy taste, great flavor. Espárragos Navarros (imported white asparagus minced onion pepper vinaigrette) - This menu white asparagus pink sauce (I think). Nice mild flavor good complement dishes major flavors. Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes gently coated spicy house tomato sauce) - The way I want potatoes - crispy covered red sauce similar hot sauce. Perfection. Pimientos De Piquillo Rellenos (piquillo peppers stuffed salted cod) - So good! That cod joke flavor amazing. I took one star service meal little slow, considering quiet Tuesday evening.

Appreciated service free pitcher beer sangria end. everyone bloated finish it, thank guys! 5.0 We went group 11 , accommodating . The sangria flowing food amazing. Definitely go want good show good food. 5.0 Four stars food:  My friend I ordered five tapas, unfortunately I remember delicious.  So I expect like everything menu. The three stars service.  It started great, forgot party end.  There birthday party seemed like bachelorette party (there table women).  And waiter completely forgot us.  Which sad soured experience. We happen catch part flamenco show, great.  But get pretty loud I'd go I wanted livelier atmosphere. 3.0 I give 5 star reviews easily. I given less 10 I reviewed hundreds businesses. This place rare distinction deserving 5 stars me. Everything food service decor perfect. The gf I weekend binge popular restaurants around manhattan. The night before, went Sakagura. You find review elsewhere Yelp. On whole, Nai definitely par better Sakagura terms dining experience. In past, I tried come around 6-8PM Saturday place packed night I told I chance seat without reservation. In hindsight, must flamenco night. This time, got 6PM Monday were, surprisingly, first customers night. We sat outside tended Uno, friendly helpful waiter. He made recommendations sangrias told us happy hour specials. $3 beers $20 pitchers sangria. $10 half pitcher. He qualms moving whole table inside got cold. The inside decor wood dimly lit, creating nice moody ambience rustic feel it. There barrels wall beer taps are. The place actually quite large New York restaurant would never expect looking outside. The tables also nicely spaced apart cramped together like sardines like restaurants try maximize seats - therefore profit - expense customer comfort. People began coming 6 8 restaurant lively time food came out. Churrasco - steak flavorful chewy enough. The garlic sauce amazing want spread bread stuff face that. Croquettes - jamon bacalao, I preferred jamon. It creamiest croquette I ever perfect crispy crust offered vital contrast soft well-whipped filling. Pulpo de la gallega - octopus far best thing I night. So tender full natural ocean flavor. How long must massaged octopus cooking it? I could eaten two plates it. Definitely rare find piece de resistance establishment. Squid ink - subtle flavor hard find anywhere else. I soaked bread ink delicious. Patatas - I bravas alioli, I liked bravas more. The patatas cut small cubes almost like hash. The flavor gets better way. The bravas nice spicy tangy red sauce smothering it. The alioli good also subtle mayo flavor. The sangrias - mango champagne pomegranate, I preferred pomegranate I like tangy drinks. The mango also good except I actually see mango component fruit drink likely used canned mango juice. In case, good I feeling quite well sharing two half pitchers gf completely inebriated end dinner. They also fine beer selection including Estrella, Mahou, San Miguel took advantage $3 pop happy hour. The service, finally, nothing short impressive. Very attentive. Super friendly. Never intrusive. We told definitely come back Thurs Sat flamenco show reserve week advance fills quickly. The whole meal ended running us tab $86 reasonable much stuffed ourselves. I added $20 tip made total north flat hundo. The sangrias full price I would think much get I plan coming amazing happy hour. Nai new favorite tapas place, better Pata Negra, La Boqueria, even arguably authentic places Spain itself. 5.0 Our group 3 walked Thursday night around 7:30. They fully booked luckily managed get seating bar 10 minutes. They Flamenco group performing Thursday Saturday nights (starts 8:30pm) I figured got lucky. Space small uncomfortable sangria came out, evening kicked nicely. Food mostly 4 stars. The 3 us got 6 small plates share: Mejillones Avoa (Mussels paprika-wine sauce): Asking bread soak mussel sauce good thing. We put effort fill bread. The mussels cooked right . 4/5 Pelotillas de Queso de Cabra (Fried goat cheese slice tomato & toast wrapped imported Serrano ham): We really loved slightly creamy texture goat cheese ham good flavor it. Came 3 toasts perfect us share. 4.5/5 Croqeutas de Cancalo (Salt cod croquettes): Crunchy outside soft inside right amount seasoning. Came 3 croquettes. 4/5 Patatas Bravas (Potatoes coated spicy house tomato sauce): This dish I like. The potatoes texture spicy house tomato sauce tasted like buffalo wing sauce. I surprised dish got lavish praises yelp. 2/5 Churraso Arriero (Skirt steak sautéed garlic spicy cherry peppers): Better I expected. The steak cooked perfectly flavors worked well. 4/5 Chorizo Salteado con Cebolla (Spanish sausage sautéed onions): The chorizo good flavor, that's matters. 4/5 In middle meal, flamenco show started. It pretty entertaining. I found pretty amazing two dancers musicians performing must tiniest stage NY. In general, I find many tapas places overcharging amount food put out. The check 6 dishes sangria pitcher $78 t&t (that's $26 pp math sucks). For quality food, service entertainment, Nai Tapas Bar knocks park terms value. 4.0 Hot, Steamy Flamenco dance show...waiter make lady happy...food make happy...win 5.0 Great food good sangria!  Watch old people get pestered big groups. 4.0 Ratings: Food 1 5 Ambiance 3 5 Service 4 5 Entertainment 3 5 Overall food kinda sucked.  Nothing really stood definitely meal I would go back for.  But fronts, good.  Service good (I wish food better).  Towards later half meal, live entertainment small "stage" towards center restaurant.  The 2 ladies performing stomp feet clap hands dance around.  I great job explaining entertaining fun first 15-20 minutes got loud boring (overdone bit, show long, difficult carry conversation show going loud long). I hate rating place badly great service sadly, dont hit mark food thats whole point going eat... 2.0 The service bomb. Our waiter recommended octopus us, got it. We ended really liking it, finish it. The waiter gave us complimentary drink noticed eat much it. The sangria fine, entire pitcher, I feel remotely buzzed. Also, little sweet taste. I also tried meatballs, nothing ordinary. Also, fried peppers stuffed cheese tasted like that. They okay, might better made spicy peppers, instead red pepper. The service great, I feel bad really wanting go back I better Spanish food city. 3.0 This Friday night hotspot authentic Spanish tapas. Unfortunately service terrible even though reservation took forever get us seated, get drinks even get food. They also bunch stuff little forgiving since like 10pm night. Once food finally came pretty good though. We stuffed red peppers, spicy potatoes, meatballs, etc. I thought peppers meatballs best overall I've better tapas. It expensive made worthwhile close karaoke bar going overall waste I need go back. 2.0 This really 4.5 stars - 'bad' thing I would say place menu could bit inventive. Its primarily Galician staples they're done quite well excellent price (I realize I'm supposed complaining right now) that's really great I'd love see bit unconventional stuff that's really style. But style incredibly affordable, well executed dishes served highly competent friendly staff. You see 'complaining' portion relatively short. We arrived 15 minutes kitchen closed Sat night and, despite informing us that, entirely reasonable, went clean table 6 make available us 2 minutes. Like watching nascar pit crew I tell you. Then brought dishes quickly yet everything clearly made. Great beer selection including Estrella tap exactly I needed go octopus, galician style. Will definitely coming back - good stuff. 5.0 Fun, authentic, absolutely perfect occasion. I growing big fan tapas. I love format sharing small plates friends, try great variety different dishes. Add pitcher two sangria (like deliciously sweet refreshing red sangria here), really can't go wrong good food good company. Some notable things I I would recommend: - Gambas al ajillo (shrimp garlic sauce) - Serrano croquettes - Patatas bravas (in red, slightly spicy tomato sauce) - Skirt steak garlic peppers - Chorizo garlic onions - Assorted jamon cheese I also like Nai offers tapas 2 different sizes, small "tapas" size larger "racion" option, making easy order less depending many people party. The service also stellar, amazing hospitality casual restaurant. 4.0 Great service food! 4.0 3.5 food; adding 0.5 affordable. The menu quite Spanish. I spent 10 days Spain, Semana Santa, nothing eating partying. So I'm reasonably familiar food tastes like there. I agree previous review food fine nothing special. I stay hours spending tons money sampling kinds tapas, like I Eslava Sevilla, locals feasted. But, East Village Spain. Hence four stars. The bartender Monday night  is super nice. 4.0 The flamenco show awesome! It fun experience! The service also really good staff attentive. I think salt-cod croquettas definitely best dish I had, followed mussells stuffed peppers. Yum! The peppers took little longer come I think that's take extra care making them. 4.0 I wanted go ages, finally went last weekend date husband.  The restaurant inside tiny, looked like one larger group tables high table (kind annoying).  I disappointed show (we went Friday). The bartender waiter (Raul) excellent - funny, quick, everything else could hope waiter. I let food, think flavorful end.  We squid, anchovies, croquetas, meatballs chorizo.  They fine really taste good (I've lived Spain well).  The one thing I absolutely enjoy tortilla .... delicious (but maybe bit eggy potato ratio).   This would good date restaurant show going on, loud small chaotic (we stopped Saturday check out).   Inexpensive, OK. 3.0 I came group girls, great took reservations. I come flamenco show maybe worth another star. The 3 stars food - good anything spectacular tapa restaurants. Make sure get pitcher sangria- THAT delcious worth coming for! 3.0 Not three stars quite four. I'd totally give place 3 1/2. A friend I randomly decided try Nai Tapas Bar Friday night hungry. I say, best thing place probably service (who even says place anymore?!?). The bartender got us table really nice waiter best. My friend worried getting fruity sangria since huge fan sweet drinks waiter hilarious helpful. He told us bit sangria promised give us cheaper deal next 1/2 pitcher like mango. Of course....we loved it! Great sangria that's sweet! You go sangria! The food hand....was ok. I know tapas portions always small I guess ordered really small. We enjoyed food nothing special. I actually really liked Squid Ink. So, whole, I'd go back Nai maybe sangria one two tapas plates. It's great atmosphere though. 3.0 Awesome tapas, sangria, service. First, tapas. They pretty legit reasonably priced. We ordered Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs), Chorizo La Plancha (grilled Spanish sausage), Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp garlic sauce), Almejas Diablo (clams spicy sauce), Pollo Al Ajillo (chicken potatoes garlic sauce). This came unlimited bread crusty perfect dipping delicious sauces. The clams really spicy (which means something, I little tolerance spicy food), great me, expecting something smoking hot, prepare disappointed. The Gambas Al Ajillo favorite--large shrimp garlicky goodness. Portion sizes pretty decent. There three us definitely full end meal. Secondly, drinks. There give take six different flavors sangria choose from. One friends previously mentioned red white wine based sangrias dryer, mango tropical flavored sangrias sweeter, champagne based sangrias middle. They sounded delicious, wanted get small sample mango flavored one decide whether sweet us (it was). I expected give us small cup take sip--but no,  awesome waiter brought us giant glass sample free! Definitely bonus. We ended getting pitcher champagne sangria, happy hour $20. The pitcher special goes whole night, glass ($5) half pitcher ($10) happy hour deals go 7PM. Third, service. I arrived bit early reservations (which pretty unnecessary, I wanted OpenTable points), I sat bar waiting friends come. The bartender friendly, explained happy hour specials, even gave tips drinks order not. Our waiter also nice (and pretty easy eyes haha) servers made sure glasses always filled sangria bread basket filled bread. If questions, definitely patient willing explain everything menu. It pretty empty went (6:30 Tuesday), food came pretty quickly. Might different story busier night. All all, solid experience. Reminded weekend trip Madrid I studied abroad. I'll definitely going back! 4.0 Great food. Great atmosphere nice waiter. I brought boyfriend, town, restaurant thoroughly enjoyed it. The bill come bad either. And I came Friday night I see dance show. Overall, I great time recommend everyone. 5.0 Great tapas experience! The tapas fairly priced ($6 average) savory. Everything seemed authentic, chorizo clams. The sauces particularly great - dip bread good top-off meal. Went around 7pm Tuesday, palce fairly empty. The waiters great! They gave us entire glass sangria wanted taste one flavor... ended getting pitcher $20 happy hour, pretty good deal. Seems like would fun place go back night live music. 4.0 Had problems getting reservation Monday night, pleasantly surprised find offer $20 pitchers sangria Mon-Wed! woooo Dining partner looooved beef empanadas, I agree quite good. Also enjoyed chorizo onion clams spicy sauce. Not fan gazpacho shot accompanying toothpick olives, beans, anchovies - supposed flavor explosion, kind weird. Was pretty disappointed boiled octopus, I found sooo textureless flavorless, blech. Ended almond tart dessert. It decent, I would rather taken money gone get dessert Blackhound around corner. Friendly fast service. Interesting they're still using paper-based system keep track orders. Might come back flamenco night see that's like~ 4.0 I went birthday dinner "good groups" category.  I also wanted small eats could share.  The food delicious probably one better tapas joints I've too. The wait looked long reservations sat quickly. Unfortunately - I realize "flamenco night."  Unless spectacle, I would avoid flamenco night.   Sadly table literally small flamenco "stage" performers even bumped friend times.  It SO loud lost voices next day. The flamenco dancing beautiful & fun watch... I would avoid Nai flamenco night looking quiet spot chat friends.  Otherwise - food good people friendly. 3.0 Love place! Make reservations, especially want good table flamenco show.  Tapas delicious.  Very close find Spain.  Highlights were: Pulpo - probably favorite. tender, smokey delicious Squid ink jamon machengo plate Grilled sardines Clams Our server soo super sweet.  We bonded Bilbao Basque background.  This definitely place I want come back to. 5.0 This place FANTASTIC. I went twice span three days. The first time I went Saturday night group friends. We happened stumble upon Nai went in. Little know live flamenco show going on! The show made restaurant way loud proper conversation, tapas made it. All food great. That first night had: -Squid ink (FANTASTIC! Especially use appetizer bread dip ink) -Caracoles (escargot sauce, great too) -Some kind chorizo, I get try -Beef empanadas (good) I went friend Monday around 5PM place quieter. There flamenco show lot free tables. This ideal time go someone like me, enjoy loud places. This time had: -Bacalaitos (AWESOME!) -Beef empanadas -The squid ink -Blood sausage (GREAT) -Some kind potato dish (which I try) Everything I've full flavor well cooked. It really makes trust  them. But best part? Their food always served HOT! I'm kind person needs food served high temperature order enjoy it. I can't stand something served cold, even served warm. Everything I Nai hot, way I like it. The service also great times. We wait long food, waiters kind attentive occasions. Definitely one favorite restaurants NYC. I can't wait return try rest dishes! 5.0 Great food, nice establishment beautiful. 4.0 My new favorite restaurant entire city. I walk place every single day life way work, I tempted try months I lover tapas flamenco. Today finally day go, I arrived around 9:40pm, asking table two. Little I know lovely friend would make wait entire hour half, staff extremely gracious fact basically losing money since table could gone someone else meantime, instead sitting waiting... waiting... waiting... You guys idea much I appreciate fact nice never tried rush me. Anyway, I decided I enough ogling everyone else's food little table remained empty I waited friend, I finally decided order things. First, gambas al ajillo, let tell you, number one reason I wanted go tapas place badly today, I craving gambas months, actually surpassed (by loooootttt) expectations. In end (yes, friend eventually show up) ordered like three servings. We also croquetas de bacalao pollo, pelotillas de queso de cabra serrano ham. I still delicious every single thing was. Absolutely fantastic. The drinks also amazing, tinto de verano pretty tasty, I mango sangría I almost died. I still cannot believe exquisite is. On top that, dessert also perfect, tarta de Santiago, beautifully balanced. Service absolute best, David Andrés became pals tonight, I definitely looking forward coming back much frequently on. The ambiance music definitely style, I knew every song played. And, let's please forget, flamenco show yet another highlight wonderful experience. This definitely place I recommending everyone I know. 5.0 This cute space.  We sat bar, woman bartending sweet also pretty attentive considering busy were.  I patatas bravas, coated spicy tomato based sauce - absolutely delicious.  I also pimientos de piquillo rellenos cheese, breaded fried pimiento stuffed small amount cheese served toast.  That one little oily me, tasted ok.  As vegetarian, options I hope try next time.   We red sangria. Heaven mercy.  It sooooooooooooo good. I chose show type home training I public, I'd home (or trust tree friends only) I would basically put straw straight pitcher.  Pretty reasonably priced ($10 tapas) flamenco live music accompaniment.   Overall, pleasant experience. :) 4.0 Yet another reason I love NYC.   Walking restaurant transported back memory far away land authentic music delicious foods. This cozy tapas bar bookshelved beautiful brick walls. Behind actual bar kegs wine sangria drinking pleasure.  (Side note Filipinos: They carry San Miguel$6!!) . Service Saturday night 10:30pm so.  Super friendly hostess directed us bar waited table.  Same lady turned server well since short handed night.  She all.  We long waits seated, ordering, served.  Fortunately live music Flamenco dancers fun distraction.  (Live Flamenco Live Flamenco shows Saturdays 7:30pm & 10:30pm).  Not mention pitchers tasty sangria kept flowing.  They come sizes: glass, half pitcher, whole pitcher. Very authentic menu. Actual Spanish people eat here.  That's good sign found good tapas joint.  Tapas reminded trip Madrid years back.   All food great flavor bit inconsistent times.  We ordered Churrasco Arriero -$19(skirt steak sautéed garlic spicy cherry peppers) enjoyed much put another order.  Our second serving left us bit unsatisfied, much flavor-as cooking process rushed.  Tortilla Espanola (traditional Spanish omlet onions & potatoes-$10)  is must order well olives stuffed anchovies potatoes.   Final round up: 4 girls:4 half pitchers sangria (try flavors, delicious!) + 8 plates hot tapas = $40/girl including tax & tip. 5.0 I last Sat 7 pm. Our last 2 guests running late host offered seat us right away. The bread gave us waited nothing special. The crust hard. The olives tasty though. When full party arrived, ordered whole bunch tapas well blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. The sangria excellent. Not strong really refreshing. I, personally, LOVED Pulpo A La Gallega (octopus), Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak), Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp garlic sauce), Pan Tumaca (serrano ham manchego cheese toast). So delicious. We also ordered pitcher red sangria- good preferred blueberry. We ordered food restaurant busy (don't know happened sudden I noticed packed) wait. And waited felt like eternity. After inquiring food, waiter Raul brought us brought us free plate tapas (i think Patatas Alioli) apology delay. And time brought us A FREE PITCHER OF SANGRIA. What? So awesome!! When got bill thought overcharged us Raul patiently explained item us. Not once, twice. I cringing inside friendly, nice, helpful (turns everything bill made sense, charged extra). We paid leaving I waited Raul come clear table. I asked name, thanked him, shook hand, gave extra bill- I THAT impressed service. Without doubt I coming back again. Oh I can't believe I almost forgot flamenco dancers!! They fantastic. It really helped create fun festive environment. Lol bother travelling Spain, j come Nai Tapas Bar!! 5.0 OMG, gem. Didn't reservation I really mood Tapas, showed up. David accommodating although super busy running around. The food great, I look back, everything ordered fried, maybe that's why? The goat cheese serrano ham toast - yummy ! The kicker amazing flamenco dancers. Who would've guessed? Our waiter Raul super attentive added whole experience warm, cozy atmosphere. I'm sure spanish yelpers comment much better food, basically I zero complaints bill end another pleasant surprise. "Nai" simply turned simple casual catchup dinner, amazing experience. 5.0 "Nai" translates "mother" Galician.  As such, images come immediately mind "Spanish mother", woman tremendous warmth always telling silly jokes, treats me, "adopted daughter", one own. After seated looking menu, I happy see food beverages made feel though I Galicia again, possibly house Spanish mother.  I never imagined I could order clarita (a draft beer La Casera - brand soda) kalimotxo (a popular mixed drink cheap red wine Coca Cola) East Village.  AND Spanish wine glass, Estrella Damm draft, favorite, Estrella Galicia, bottle. On particular Monday, bar special day $20 large pitcher sangria.  With five flavors available, unsure order requested taste mango sangria committing whole pitcher.  Our waiter brought us large glass (which let us finish charge us for!) us surprised taste sweet refreshing white-wine based sangria, lots wine-soaked apples. As tapas, probably best I United States (and say quite statement!).  Many recipes menu passed Ana Maria Gonzalez Arias' grandmother, hails Galicia. You MUST order pulpo la gallega.  It tender practically melted mouth (FYI: octopus never "texture" chewy).  When asked waiter recipe, said preparation Spain: octopus boiled briefly water 3 4 times heat lowered cook normally. The albondigas also fantastic.  A pork-beef combination used meatball everything slowly cooked tomato-brandy sauce.  Be sure use slice bread two enjoy sauce! We also ordered combination croquetas de jamon de bacalao.  The filling croquetas de jamon perfect - runny pasty.  Because bacalao delicate fish, flavors croquetas got little "lost".  Although I preferred croquetas de jamon savory, enjoyable. The beauty Spanish food sometimes simplest ingredients basic preparations enjoyable.  The bacalao frito, preparation cod fish lightly battered fried served aioli sauce, perfect example this.  The handful ingredients used allowed us appreciate fresh fish was. Last, certainly least, shared slice brazo gitano dessert.  Once again, I flooded memories Spanish mother always makes savory version sponge cake filled practically anything.  Nai's rendition traditional dessert used almond-sugar filling drizzled chocolate.  The sponge cake perfectly moist, making perfect way end meal. Our waiter extremely attentive shared enthusiasm menu us course dinner.  He also gave us additional information flamenco performances take place weekend told us hoped would return.  I happy found place brings back memories Spain, serving affordable food drink atmosphere makes feel like family. 5.0 I tried restaurant first time recently group 5 friends. We seated right away  the service remained excellent entire meal. The waiter friendly attentive. We red wine sangria (pitcher $20) tasty! We ordered 6 "racions" aka larger tapas. We agreed plenty food. Each dish better next, got everything garlic shrimp skirt steak. At end surprised total bill, bargain! We definitely going back. 4.0 Stopped quick bite eat last night. We ordered pitcher champagne sangria (yum) special $20! We ordered shrimp green sauce, octopus (galician style), skirt steak sauteed garlic spicy cherry peppers. Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak) - Probably best dish. Ours cooked perfectly medium meat well flavored tender. The sauce/garnish came refreshing, I loved pickled cherry peppers. Pulpo A La Gallega (octopus) - Our server warned might little chewy...honestly bit soft! I feel like texture smelled bit fishy. Maybe day dish, definitely par octopus tapas I've had. Shrimp green sauce - The sauce delicious. We sopped whole thing bread provided. Overall, ambiance nice. We sat outside hot humid, servers attentive came frequently pour champagne sangria, refill water, check us. I thought dishes bit pricey compared tapas joints, vegetarian dishes bit cheaper. Evens end. I would recommend coming sometime Mon-Wed taking advantage $20 pitcher! 4.0 Every while, one show ponies stable thoroughbreds wants edification special.  So, I gotz ta I gotz ta do...take deelish dinner.   In case, since Castillian, since I've Spain multiple times, I took legit tapas bar impress her. - Decor/Ambience: Pretty packed loud...but fun.  I'm flamenco connoisseur, def cool watch. - Draaaanks: White sangria kind tart mango sagria chains...drank waaaay much (which status quo date) - Fare: Tapas ubiquitous Spain I'm always NYC...so ordered: * beef empanadas * blood sausages * skirt steak sauteed garlic * seasoned pork loin * potatoes creamy garlic aioli sauce * potatoes spicy tomato sauce * meat cheese plate * spanish octopus Except pork loin (kinda salty), fuckin deeelish. * As dessert I order any, I already taking home me. ;) 5.0 Great food! Amazing service! Festive atmosphere! I dined birthday super happy overall experience! Our server, Raul fantastic made sure happy night! The place gets little loud expect intimate convo flamenco dancing starts. BUT looking fun spot dinner great good, Nai spot! 4.0 In honest opinion, tapas made girls. That's we've decided venture girls night out. It spectacular experience suitable catharsis. In terms food drinks, here's I say... Blueberry Pomegranate Sangria - First pitcher potent. Second pitcher hit spot Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak sauteed garlic spicy cherry peppers) - Best dish TOO well done, made chewy Lomo Adobado Con Pimientos Asados (seasoned pork loin fresh roasted red peppers) - Definitely tender lack flavors. More gravy would awesome Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes gently coated spicy house tomato sauce) - Perfectly seasoned mild kick. Sweetly done Patatas Alioli potatoes basted creamy garlic alioli sauce - Ultimately creamy garlic flavor. Tasted like plain mayo Mejillones Rias Baixas (galician style mussels garlic, virgin olive oil white wine) - Bland. Sand. Flat Pulpo A La Gallega (spanish octopus virgin olive oil, sprinkled sea salt sweet paprika) - Nicely spiced overcooked. A little texture would great Esparragos Navarros (imported white asparagus minced onion pepper vinaigrette) - Fancy sogginess killed asparagus' taste With mentioned above, still room dessert (which hoping for). This place little hard find got misguided confusing Yelp (Google) map. However, friendliness staff made all. Will try come back Thursday night catch live flamenco dance performance. 4.0 What order: Red Mango Sangria Beef Empanadas Blood Sausages Potatos Garlic Aioli Sauace Meatballs Meat cheese plate What order: Chicken potatos Cod croquettes Garlic Shrimp Mussells Overall: Great friendly tapas spot. Lighting semi bright contrary dark tapa places. The sangria one best I ever good price. The tapas extremely tasty order right ones. The flamingo drums weekends lively. It turns boring date upbeat energetic dinner. The notable thing place service. The staff one friendliest I ever seen feel right home. I always OVER tip Nai. 4.0 Went quick bite late Tuesday night pleasantly surprised speed quality food. Can't miss albondigas fried goat cheese bread serrano ham. Delicious! Make sure bread comes, sauces worth soaking up. 4.0 I've already twice span week half, there's good reason that. I randomly stumbled upon place one day, I walking around East Village. What initially caught eye, sign live flamenco dancing Thursday Saturday nights. A group friends I decided try Thursday night, certainly went beyond exceeding expectations. Our waiter, Raul, polite helpful also quite patient six us took time deciding order. In meantime, made sure glasses remained filled blueberry pomegranate sangria - great choice many flavors. Plates MUST HAVE: Bacalao Frito, Chorizo A La Plancha, Patatas Alioli, Empanadillas De Carne, Pork Tenderloin (Spanish name escapes me)...to name few. I could go I'll end saying - looking low key spot intense vibe, great service even greater food...look further. With friendly staff food affordable price (and amazing flamenco dancers/Spanish music Thurs Sat)....is wonder reviews Nai Tapas nothing amazing? 5.0 We came (based good yelp reviews), saw (the flamenco dancing), ate (everything!) drank merry (blueberry pomegranete champagne sangria hit spot). It started reservation two Thursday night.  One joined, followed another, another another.  The staff incredibly nice kept helping us find bar stools much appreciated even though packed house!     Reminder self: great date spot lively evening catch friends. 5.0 Great service, delicious food sangria perfect, much ice enough fruit! You MUST order: Gambas A La Plancha Aceitunas Rellenas Croquetas De Bacalao Drinks bad, hot chocolate watered latte burnt taste it. The food also poor quality, service worst part, cashier rude. 1.0 This worst experience I've ever casual coffee/light fare place.  The server disappeared 20 minutes, talking friend window girlfriend I sat dumbfounded dude nerve job.  We're trying make eye contact, clearly getting paid talk bud important him. My girlfriend went counter server disappeared back another 5 minutes (what guy doing?) asked order food something.  The girl counter gives weird look says "I'll get server."  When arrive back, look table laugh.  Yeah, leaving us hanging half-a-goddamn hour place two customers funny - retrospect, collective incompetence false sense entitlement certainly was. The food okay.  For place called "toast," I'd figured bread would better, cold Le Bus.  Additionally, I'm 95% sure "andouille" special link pre-packaged offering Trader Joe's cut four pieces.  $9 unapologetic mediocrity happening again. Avoid place like plague.  I almost leave tip, honestly I have.  I felt buyer's remorse day.  What disgrace. 1.0 This located site old Spruce St. Video.  The mild cofee good pastris great.  At times, service slow even busy times patrons receive complimentary mimosa drink.  The WIFI good. 3.0 I enjoyed coffee breakfast twice Toast recent visit Philly. The first morning I enjoyed Omelette du Jour savory filling roast tomato, portobello, artichoke, goat cheese, wilted spinach. It accompanied crisp small side salad baby greens, tomato, berries. The house dressing light complementary, powering. I HAD complement chef. The barista recommended pour coffee disappoint. He prepared cup care attention time form. I followed pour wonderful latte, prepared well. As I leaving town, I decided visit breakfast long trip ahead. This breakfast delicious Eggs Benedict combo perfectly done complemented mushrooms, roast tomato, generous helping wilted greens. A rich cup melted butter accompanied dish sweet side salad brought balance meal. This time barista made perfect cup French Pressed Guatemalan Vienna roast coffee. It balanced bright, yet rich flavor. I second cup go! Cudos barista, chef, friendly staff. Toast definitely place visit, eat, enjoy coffee prepared variety ways. Don't miss one! 5.0 I love Toast! The food choices fantastic - I love serve brunch day, coffee well brewed prepared. I'm fan large windows - perfect location sit people watch little while. Nestled Center City, Toast provides people like travel city work little de-stress kick back little bit. The staff wonderfully friendly always eager provide suggestions sure get.  Now school starting back also makes perfect environment settle studying. I love fact play Maps Yeah Yeah Yeah's - related Pandora stations - really sets mood unwind casual conversation friends. Can't wait go back! 5.0 The egg English muffin (their take eggs Benedict) fantastic. Service quick pleasant. They multiple roasters providing coffee barista knew make good cup. They La Marzocco Strada espresso choose Chemex, French Press, Fetco filter coffee. There plenty seating, well lot, comfortable. Free wifi available. Good stuff. 5.0 wonderful relaxed vibe fantastic homemade English muffins. best Earl Grey tea Center City.....looking forward outdoor seating Spring. friendly helpful staff delight! 5.0 Extremely slow kitchen. I went hour eat shift told server information well. I got canned fruit omelette 45 minutes later. I boxed left. About 2 weeks later I waiting quick hem asked fastest thing could make, bagel cream cheese answer. That took 15 minutes. Don't come time constraints. 1.0 I really wanted love toast. It's quaint cozy, perfect place hop call layover Philadelphia. I figured I'd get latte food there. The latte upwards $4 small. I also ordered turkey sausage grilled cheese, I believe around $10. We sat availed free wifi (great perk) waiting food, came within 15 mins. I took bite crunchy grilled cheese, basically size wonder bread slice, immediately horrified. This grilled cheese turkey sausage; fucking abomination. I spread sandwich ONE slice cheese it--it dry even gooey sticky. Also, ONE turkey sausage link sliced half spread diagonally across sandwich. I would say approximately 70% sandwich turkey-less. The server happened nearby boyfriend said something grilled cheese cheese...and happily took back made new one, cheese amount turkey sausage. It nice gesture honestly, highway robbery serve sandwich charge $10 it. At sandwich costs $2 make...and I'm including side salad greens. Overall, toast needs step game. A little less stingy cheese, Some small tweaks menu, slightly reasonable prices, place would great. 2.0 First brunch experience Philly (actually entire life), oh man, I see brunch thing. My friends I initially planned Green Eggs Café, would wait 45 minutes table, came instead. Not waitress seat us quickly, place also provided toasty ambience. (No pun intended.) I ordered plate special egg toast: two poached eggs served atop homemade split English muffin, smoked salmon asaparagus side. (I opted Hollandaise sauce.) O-M-G. While I get runny yolk porn experience, bite delicious sensation salty savory. Also, English muffin point - chewy carb-y. I definitely recommend place nice brunch minus terribly long line. 4.0 Coffee great I live close convenient! I've handful times eaten twice. Their homemade English muffins delish! I mine jam. I've also avocado toast. It's poached eggs homemade bread alfalfa sprouts plenty avocado side. It comes side salad well. It's really good heavy alfalfa sprouts, I took fine that! Their setup nice, windows, plenty seating even handful plugs want work, I appreciate. Their service leaves something desired though. Weekdays counter service, understandable people work coffee probably want bothered still, attention would nice. I find utensils etc girl counter completely forgot I one waiting food, minutes. I'm good customer service little disappointing I still go coffee pastries. For neighborhood tons coffee shops one pretty good! 3.0 My family I found hidden gem looking place park get breakfast traveling day. We loved everything! The space cute. The food amazing! The juice coffee nice fresh! We impressed Alex, guy took order counter, delivered food table, also cleared tables seem keep line counter moving pretty fast!!!

There egg toast (pretty much eggs Benedict) good many different forms. I egg toast avocado wife one salmon. I'm huge fish guy said good. 5.0 Great Location, Love vibe, food love service, highly recommended!!! 5.0 Toast comfortable artistic environment good food affordable prices. You spend $5 home made English muffin coffee go larger plate $15. My chia tea brewed site instead mix (hooray!) exceptionally creamy. My truffled egg sandwich right portion fresh salad side strawberries. They huge windows flood space light. The decor cosy meets sculptural mismatched pillows modern artistic lighting. Our check came delightfully attached giant clothespin. It early I went, crowd, staff friendly, fast. 4.0 I stopped Toast way work use pc  and decided try  the eggs benedict  as hungry time kill....What surprise !This far best EB"'s  I've city far. They use real baked  ham wonderful salad rather usual home fries side..  Ive back many times since disappointed yet.  A+ ps -  english muffins home made boot! 5.0 Toast ok. My goat cheese, tomato spinach omelet actually pretty good coffee pretty good too. I hummus plate hummus pretty good. But kind expensive although pretty good great. Which whole thing. It's fine. There's nothing wrong exciting way. I kind pissed make kid plain omelette though clearly capable so. Weird. Nice space. 2.0 Really see vegan items menu. Soy milk even listed option board. I got decent soy cappuccino I better. I need go again. 2.0 The Toast town! 5.0 NOISE! Good food, OK coffee, moderate price much noisy terrible heating/AC system enjoy peaceful meal. 2.0 Fantastic time Toast! The omelet day spinach, goat cheese Capri tomatoes--Yum! Spritzers fab perfect quencher warm day. I also bowl fresh fruit unlike cafés fruit FRESH! It fridge dying icy death perfect strawberries, blueberries, blackberries banana. My kids (3 x 13y + 1(24y) 1 gal pal (13y)) ate everything plates want return. Above service wonderful! 5.0 I would give toast 3.5 stars, option, I'll round 4.  The food pretty good, although basic. Their menu tons options. The place fills quickly weekends, come weekday afternoon study get work done.  I felt french toast tasted kind plain scrambled eggs menu (at brunch place?!?), perhaps changed since last time I went there.  I highly recommend spritzers. They yummy refreshing hot day. 4.0 Solid little tea selection here, plus carry sip n' glo juices (they expensive, good)!  The hours convenient, (Monday Friday 7-7 Saturday/Sunday 8-6).  The hummus wrap looked delightful, sadly, I hungry enough I stopped in.  I definitely back try update accordingly! 4.0 Toast potential amazing - food excellent coffee, service lacking. Came two friends brunch Sunday. We seated immediately though host friendly, rude either. I'm hostess though could've done A LOT better. Anyway, friends ordered lattes I ordered double shot espresso. It took 20 minutes receive coffee..For food, sure, 20 minutes fast, receive drinks?! Did I miss something? It even crowded, I idea took long. If crowded, I'd understand little more. When get food drinks, everything good, complaints there! Friendlier wait-staff better service would make place 5-stars. Toast cute great food, rush go! 4.0 AWFUL! Had half hour kill a.m. bypassed Capogiro go read good things it. What mistake!! First girl working counter barely acknowledged me. When -made eye contact, made wait phone. When finally waited whispered impossible hear god awful fan racket coming kitchen. I waited almost 10 mins get capp - I ONLY one waiting.  When finally get hot. The fan noise kitchen deafening whole place reeked old sandwiches curry, I think. Couldn't leave fast enough. SO relaxing cup coffee hoping for. When I left clothes smelled curry something. It awful. Angry going way unpleasant experience. Only good thing croissant (which sure came elsewhere). 1.0 Finally got try Toast passing many times. It didnt quite live expectations hence 4 star rating, still nice! Came brunch around noon place almost full. The ambience great - clean yet rustic feel white floors/metallic light fixtures contrasting wooden tables/chairs. We got hot chocolate blue lady black tea. The cups quite big, hot choc delicious overly chocolatey fruity refreshing. We got "egg toasts" - avocado truffled mushroom. I agree another yelper avocado could fresher dishes could used little flavor (garlic, salt, onions etc) - adding little hot sauce helped. My boyfriend's poached egg turned fully cooked egg dissapointing waited awhile order (5-10 minutes get drink order another 20 food). But salad surprisingly good - lightly dressed good balance veggies fruits. Our server friendly apologized wait times. Overall - service bit slow food bit bland (for personal taste) staff friendly ambience great. Probably come back drink sometime instead!! 4.0 I love place coffeeshop feel without coffee shop. It's great place study high ceilings giant windows feels spacious without much square footage. Their internet fast little bar us like occasionally stand study. While service little slow, ridiculous baristas friendly. I negative experience yet. The food delicious. They omelettes toast related things, soups along coffees teas I literally day long busy never leave. I'm fan veggie chili occasional wrap, still try menu. 5.0 I think one cutest coffee shops ever.  Visiting night staying across street twice already.  I NY, comments, nothing expensive compared.  Would definitely stop by. 5.0 I've come couple times I love place. Coffee good, service quick food good. I got lox Benedict delicious. Cute little place go weekends. We also much wait coming Sunday kind unheard Philly. I definitely come back! 5.0 On Sunday, I ordered soy caramel latte. They caramel, vanilla, I settled mocha paid. The employees realized soy milk. It happens, way handled it... They completely unphased unapologetic. Just refund "k cya". I'm convinced customer service dead city recent experience Toast reaffirmed that. 1.0 Toast, killing me. I've tried many times like place since I live close it, one disappointment another. The prices oddly absurd. I got small coffee tiny muffin (about 1-2 inches diameter) came almost $6! Not mention muffin absolutely flavor kind stale. I hate feel regret making purchase happened times Toast now. They get business convenience weather gross go somewhere farther. 1.0 Excellent breakfast spot, good coffee, course, wonderful toast! 4.0 Toast shockingly good breakfast place.  Their sandwich board outside always seems advertising tea desserts, breakfast brunch really at. On low end, restaurant-quality egg sandwiches food truck prices. The rest menu quite small, I think designed sort restaurant-managing genius, every item I've tried basically best I've ever eaten. Wilted greens egg toast?  The plate beautifully deliciously covered greens mushrooms, homemade muffins crispy perfect, hollandaise excellent.  Hummus plate?  I expect much, actually amazing -- highlight salted bagel chips, somehow crunchy chewy.  And I've never better yogurt parfait anywhere: chewy honey granola perfect, use plain Pequea Valley yogurt already favorite, thing loaded berries. 5.0 WTF SURLY BARISTA?  When I stumble 7am, I expect least smile.  When I ask green tea, ass sigh say "only like FIVE" give advice.  I know shit green tea! Also, red eye last time stunk. BOOOO HISS. 2.0 really awesome neighborhood cafe. staff friendly helpful. waiter put best corner spot work hours. coffee food pretty decent prices. incorporating spot brunch cycle. really love soundtrack too--belle & sebastian, modest mouse, lots shins. 4.0 Overall, good cappuccino.  Strong coffee flavor, smoky aftertaste.  I normally prefer creamy consistency, sour tinge end, I much mind taste Toast's cappuccino.  Verging $4 territory, pricey drink.  Although I sample, fold menu looked intriguing.  Also, went cold day seating area opposite toasty.  Worth visit though. 4.0 Came brunch good. Friendly staff, food arrived timely manner. I love Toast supports local art community featuring work local artists. 4.0 Just moved neighborhood I'm happy little cafe block away. The barista friendly, atmosphere quiet relaxing inviting. The kitchen closed tonight I'll hold fifth star till I try food, definitely spot visit. My cappuccino delicious artfully made. 4.0 Wonderful. Just wonderful. I walk, cycle, train long distances well made cappuccino cozy place sit work. When offer sort whole grain option quick breakfast (bagels, oatmeal), better. When staff polite sweet courteous skilled---I fall love. Seriously happy Toast. I'll enjoy coming weekday mornings write (it's quiet time!). And short 2-block walk 12th/Locust PATCO speedline station (I live Collingswood). Expertly crafted soymilk cappuccino pumpernickel bagel $5.50, plus $1.00 tip (baristas deserve tips, too!). 5.0 Nice vibes, ok food warm service. Good prices much food it. 3.0 I. Love. Toast. My favorite Café study in...also favorite green tea eggs benny toast. 5.0 I've once. The coffee fine. The hot line nice change Philly cafes, I like basic egg sandwich---it quite dry. Service slow, one barista working. (At 9am weekday... ouch! I envy him.) 2.0 Great atmosphere great coffee! 4.0 place upon walking smelled like pan burnt bacon. overpowering. exhaust? staff welcoming seemed though couch area break room. eating, hanging out. even mop bucket stored open customers could sit next eat by, couch taken employees is. cup coffee good. hours later garments still smell like 4 day old burnt cast iron skillet. blah. 1.0 Great food drinks. Fresh salads sandwiches quality ingredients. Good service atmosphere. Sometimes wait small. 3.0 Great expensive coffee. Their large 16oz $3. Not much variety to-go food. When walk in, know whether seat hostess seat you. This awkward want waiter service coming quick bite catch work. English muffins amazing along homemade jam. 3.0 Toast expanded  menu offerings since original review. The daily specials they've added make interesting options. I also like food generally healthy, right sized portions fair prices go them. They've able make small kitchen space, earning another star me. 5.0 This really nice place get hot chocolate near 12th spruce. It's fast convenient affordable. I come lot since brother apartment close it, next building it. So far I've tried hot chocolate nine times ten I would get instead coffee, I've seen food menu tried anything yet tried small macaroon good airy tasty. 5.0 Came breakfast people service lacking! Took anyone acknowledge us. Once seated, waited long I got grabbed menus table. The waitress/host nice enough, busy. Homemade English muffins dry!!! I ordered breakfast sandwich egg, cheese, bacon. Bacon good, whole sandwich dry. My friend received wrong order said could re-do it, would take 15 minutes. We already waited long enough 4 breakfast sandwiches. Coffee tea good. Relaxed ambiance nice. I would return unless lot time waste like dry sandwiches. 2.0 I'm giving guys 4 stars, really 3.5.  Ate brunch boyfriend yesterday overall super happy everything, although blips could work full 5-star material.  First, I served delicious hot coffee cute mug - milk sugar even spoon.  I carefully carry hot mug milk/sugar station across room (it small room, that's good), hunt clean spoon since none available station.  If serving sit-down brunch, patrons able remain sitting prepping coffee. The food also really good, also consistently awesome across board.  My boyfriend smoked salmon poached eggs hollandaise homemade English muffins.  It amazing 0 hollandaise right amount lemony thin feel refreshing, gloopy fatty.  His English muffin also tender delicious. My dish, hand, hard English muffin, slices less-than-good avocado perched atop sprouts topped poached eggs side roasted tomatoes.  The tomatoes bomb eggs sprouts fine, avocado sucked.  They even black strings - that's good avocado. This whole dish would 10 times delicious pesto, hopefully read add :) It seems like staff new there's definitely potential improve little inconsistencies Toast.  I'll definitely go back next time I'm Philly. 4.0 Toast really nice relaxed ambiance.  I stopped go friend impressed. They nice variety teas coffee.  I tried chai tea latte, delicious.  My friend tried one exciting tea blends, loved it.  We also bagels, little pricey, great on-the-go breakfast.  I'd love come back sit-down experience I loved space lots windows, comfortable-looking seats pillows, open space. 4.0 I found walking Toast I area photo shoot.  It cold day corner coffee joint I needed.  I liked vibe soon I walked in.  It good look, bustling people drinking coffee eating.  The staff friendly menu offered I looking for.   While I waited coffee made, I grabbed seat little sofa.  A great spot relax, people watch consume caffeine.  The prices totally fair, nothing crazy.  My drink good served added touch Barista art.  I'd visit I find area again. 3.0 Not big breakfast person place changed mind. Wasn't pleased coffee poached eggs smoked salmon decided breakfast new favorite meal dessert. Hollandaise sauce? Perfection. Greens fruits? Fresh succulent. I never give son juice added sugar, Toast, fresh squeeze ripe orange juice is.  The reason get 5 latte tasted watered service bit snotty. But barring that, Toast brunch occasion... I wonder take out... 4.0 I absolutely love Toast.  I live ton coffee shops/brunch places Toast favorite.  Very friendly staff, best cup coffee area, incredible bacon, egg, cheese croissants.  A little pricey side, get pay for. 5.0 I sooo pleased Toast neighborhood.  After space went empty restaurant coffeeshop/restaurant coffeeshop, time solid cafe took root.  The decor simple airy, given large glass windows facing 12th Spruce Streets.  I love sitting cushioned window seats lounging pillows I pretend work really people watch.  The space ideal study, brunch friends grab-and-go coffee. The coffee quite tasty offer multiple varieties.  They seasonal drinks offer juices smoothies.  Yum!  Have coffee juice breakfast complete.  But want something substantial, choose croissants, bagels, brownies salads sandwiches.  I personally like hummus wrap full nutrients fresh flavors.  Good morning evening work sessions. Lastly, I comment owners staff friendly accommodating.  I always pleasant chats baristas, recent visit noticed cup holding everyone's loyalty cards (so remember bring you)!  Best neighborhood coffee spot! 4.0 This place different taste breakfast brunch, I'm fan. You find basics: eggs way, pancakes... know I mean. BUT! find fresh perspective fresh ambience, fresh service, fresh food, fresh view street corner seat house. The quirky highlight - toast theme. Toast takes eggs benedict different level. It's dish smothered hollandaise. Instead, seven varieties called "egg toasts," $10.50 less. Still poached eggs sitting top english muffin (they're fresh baked premise), toppings vary. We ordered "warm apples" egg toast came baked apple, sausage, white cheddar. Delicious, appropriate "responsible" portion (read: big feel like junk after), served side salad. Perfect size E-money. I egg sandwich. Starts $2.50 pay extra things like tomato, avocado, cheese, bacon/sausage, etc. Bacon ($1.75), avocado ($2), smoked gouda ($1) choices delicious english muffin (couldn't tell cheeses available - smoked gouda first heard stopped server there). Other "toast" choices include white, wheat, baguette, bagel, croissant. The sandwich disappoint. Cheese melted, let taste smoked gouda really come through. Egg fried. Add ketchup Tapatio hot sauce can't go wrong. Our side turkey sausage a-ok, nothing get excited about. Curious whether make sausage bring in. Coffee drinkers expect good cup joe - E-money super picky coffee gave Toast's warm cup ringing endorsement. If prefer tea, like me, pleased variety. I ginger mint! Really enjoyed breakfast Toast. Showed little 10am  on Saturday wait, tough thing come days brunch craze. I bought dark chocolate, sea salt brownie I paid bill counter - looks awesome. Expect see back Toast hurry - probably follow suit. 4.0 Super convenient considering I live top coffee shop! I love coffee free mimosa weekends brunch. You heard free mimosa!!! It get better hearty healthy breakfast mimosa. This place still new I would assume brunch menu continually evolve become much expansive time. Right get traditional brunch stuff like eggs bacon omelates interesting menu! Did I mention free mimosa? I also like vibe place goes back coffee shop roots, I student I would definitely hang toast study consume coffee! 4.0 Very cute coffee shop. Quick nice service. A group us head afternoon fun. Since Mother Nature angry giving us heat waves, ordered iced drinks. All tasty caffeine trick. 3.0 Super-cute, comfy, everyone nothing friendly helpful.   The reason missing star things bit expensive side here. I probably stop coffee go... planning camping use wifi read, makes sense invest nice comfortable setting. 4.0 Great decor vibe. Secured wifi. Excellent freshly-queezed OJ. Fantastic eggs Benedict lox asparagus. Service could friendlier. But overall still excellent option brunch lunch. Too bad air ventilation poor: every time went (i.e. dozens) 45 minutes café, eyes would start itching. And 60 mins would leave, point would smelling like cooked kitchen couple hours. So reason, we've stopped going. Too bad. 4.0 Excellent coffee nice sandwiches. Really good quick breakfast relaxing cup coffee.The bagels really decent I'm New Yorker! 4.0 Great idea, great menu, awful food. My sandwich undercooked eggs...and hair :( 1.0 I rate coffee since company roasts brew right, really know pull great shot espresso! The food exemplary, service always smile. Great shop, always stop I neighborhood. 5.0 YOLO, I'm kind glad live once, I hope successor also follow namesake, Toast, I like you, I want toast. PROS For studying spot gets 5 stars: quiet, (aside pleasant background music), usually study spots near outlets, abundance pillows comfort, reliable wifi, high ceilings, good people watching zone out, last least... never anyone (although bode well future place, I selfishly love emptiness). They take credit cards I found food reasonably priced (although I can't vouch quality). They actually extensive menu salads eggs benedict (around $10) well cheaper toast/bagel options. The one barrista super sweet, first time I came working, friendly I stop figure I knew actually best friend I'd forgotten I had, super awesome. It latter. She also took pity us brought us water we'd miserably staring screens/books hours. CONS Drinks bit overpriced (2.75 tea?) huge selection teas. The AC spotty last week, they've resolved issue I think. Highly recommend study spot, place weekday/all day quiet breakfast/brunch/snack/solo dining. So let's raise toast Toast, hope one sticks. 4.0 Stumbled upon great cafe looking brunch one day. Great "egg toasts" - version eggs benedict, variety ways. Excellent coffee espresso beverages, everyone really friendly! 5.0 Went around noon Sunday Memorial Day weekend, 2013.  Sat outside. Ordered something amounted eggs benedict mushrooms, side turkey sausage, french pressed coffee.   Service good -  attentive friendly.   Coffee came first.  Under brewed.  Brown color.  Poached eggs undercooked, barely.  Eggs atop seemed like english muffin, toasted, chewy :-P   Turkey sausage, silver dollar form, tasted funny.  Everything tepid, except iced water. I mention anything service.  I think asked. It's nice space, coffee options great.  I hope get better execution food drink. 2.0 Decor nice, food coffee decent. It's good enough justify prices, though. 3.0 This place new, quaint. The coffee superb, well-made. Each cup make grind french press. Don't go full, food equally good.. I got poached eggs toast (YUM). This location near everything, short walk Midtown Village Gayborhood shopping after. Very cool vibe here, quick, friendly service. This place deserves attention. 4.0 I absolutely enthusiastic cute coffee shop finally opening space! The space decent, loud overrun like coffee shops area, staff extremely nice helpful! I giving three stars, however, definitely room improvement. I understand opened still working identity, I think could little meals coffee. I huge tea drinker unimpressed tea list. A good sweet non-caffeine tea usually favorite, fall short. They could use fun flavors like ginger, lemon, vanilla rooibos, etc. I also expand "snack" section too. I sure something want do, however, want weekday coffee shop, offering little snacks like fruit, granola bars, nuts, perhaps even health smoothies could really go long way student want full meal, little something hold over. All said, breakfasts absolutely amazing coffee espresso selections great. What do, well, could benefit little growth. 3.0 Finally cafe spot I like. Ever since Oddfellows closed down, I set foot place. (For reason I bring frequent restaurant called YOLO) I tried food yet, I coffee study, ambience friendly, iced coffee tasty, server's British accent quite charming. See soon, Toast! 4.0 It's common give 5-star review Toast earned it.   They earn easy 3 stars food coffee.  It tastes great, eggs bacon done perfectly order.  I feel like prices low enough I feel guilty stopping times week. The fourth star earned unfussy cute cafe seating area free wifi.  They mind hanging hours weekday get work done enjoying coffee egg sandwich.  Way better food ambiance chain coffee shops - great place casual morning business meeting. We've visit Sunday brunch too.  They extra people there's never wait. The fifth star due wonderful customer service.  The two girls I see almost time welcoming friendly.  After first visits, recognize know I'm going order.   I definitely keep coming back Toast, I hope fares better YOLO Odd Fellows. 5.0 Toast cute place cute name! I'm happy coffee shop block reopened...and reopened better (formerly known YOLO formerly known Odd Fellows)! Everyone works Toast friendly I love bright atmosphere. Their coffee strong amazing. I'm big fan Americanos lattes. 5.0 I really like place lot! Came brunch friends town. Green Eggs packed Valanni wasnt open yet...little know great time would Toast! The staff great efficient. Even werent sure would staying eat, happily sat us drink orders. We ended deciding stay happy lattes meals. I got poached eggs vegetarian chili avocado---yummmm. I loved fresh side salad came with. The downer would $3 substitute charge "large" portion side potatoes friend didnt want side salad. But that, great experience. Nice ambiance great people watching. Even though smaller place, didnt try rush us table. Much appreciated! 4.0 Paid $7 bagel lox go. I got one tiny sliver lox. And took 15 minutes. What complete joke. 2.0 The cafe pretty cute. It mix chairs comfy booth seats fancy pillows dress up. The staff also friendly. When looking menu outside, prices coffee seemed little high, boyfriend I decided check anyway. We ordered drip coffee cost less expected, I think must looking price french pressed coffee one fancy variations....The coffee bit weak, maybe I'm fan dark roasts, light one. I'm definitely willing give second chance maybe try food next time I saw guests chowing tasty-looking breakfast. 3.0 Was quite excited new place, say rather disappointed.  The service lacklustre, like everything bit much trouble.  And sadly food, beautifully presented, live promise.  The place selling "toast", really serving perfectly toasted English muffins.  Ours soft enough middle toasted.  Coffee fine nothing write home about. Overall, nothing offensive place.  It underwhelming enough bother going back, city packed great brunch places. 3.0 FInally place I relax enjoy atmosphere without costing fortune. It clean cozy. Staff personable. Great place lazy day informal date. 4.0 I'm relatively new PHL, however place changed name +/- management 3-4 times far. One would imagine abysmal business would learn attempts reinvent itself. This new edition, Toast, clearly well again, judging persistent lack clientele. The day I walked in, hardly anything done decor. It remains bland unoriginal, despite prime geo location. A mere Earl Grey cost CC café astonishing dollar! My surprise meant I discussed issue partner wondered management place thinking. Today, I decided go place again, give another assessment. Like before, mere couple customers bored looking barista. The toll, $2.95 16 oz coffee! Extortionate worst transaction AMEX long time. When consider good coffee somewhere else Center City around $1.75 realise absurd Toast is. Justification? Coffee beans grown extraterrestrial soil fertilised manure produced last unicorn? Won't returning here. 1.0 I love cafe. It's fantastic place study. There's wi-fi outlets. Decent coffee tea. I enjoy chai, creamy slightly sweet. Great comfortable environment. I love eggs benedict, I can't wait try food one day. I love love LOVE place! 5.0 I three times breakfast & love it.  The poached eggs sausage, cheddar cheese & dijonnaise great!  Only downside gets hot sunny & shades keep sun eyes. 4.0 This place opened street me, I excited finally something otherwise vacant storefront month ago. Toast nice place stop speciality coffee, latte, espresso really know they're there. However, comes ordering food breakfast sandwiches egg toasts, they're pretty slow. So prepared wait. However, lazy Saturday Sunday time kill, seat one pillowed booths enjoy. 3.0 First Odd Fellows memorable quality name. Then YOLO (You Only Live Once) bad tasteless name. Now simply Toast. This time someone got right. That someone V., owns Chhaya East Passyunk  avenue. V brings high qualityingredients superb cooking  to Center City. With distinctly uncomplicated flare choose sandwiches, salads, pastries list sides. You mix match stick classic "bacon , egg cheese" and, voila, done. There's fussiness Center City dining gets nerves. I hate server can't pronounce menu items foreign word phrase used English would suffice. Toast chucks fussiness breakfast lunch fare. This streamlined method I want I still slightly drunk night stomach "carb-cheese-MEAT" mode. Great  morning midday meals, toast win Center City. 4.0 Replacing YOLO Cafe, Toast eclectic blend loose leaf teas & coffee, delicious "egg toasts" (poached eggs top homemade english muffins), sandwiches homemade goodies. *Try egg toast warm apples, white cheddar cheese, sausage dijonnaise! AMAZING. I'm impressed revamping place, interior cozy, clean perfect brunch friends studying Thursday afternoon. The baristas helpful, friendly warm. I coming weekly basis. Cheers Toast! 5.0 Great atmosphere, clean awesome coffee! We needed place like neighborhood! :) 4.0 There good news bad news. The good news, make good cup coffee. Now bad. I looking place stop cup coffee. First, I passed right place. It looked like regular restaurant me, isn't, coffee shop. I confused coffee shop called "toast".  As really sell anything toasted. It looks like typo, I think meant call "roast". As would made sense. The places looks great, selling Caribbean food. It looks light tropical looking  with floor ceiling windows. The menu confusing. You need wine expert understand "hint" favor note. Meaning, favored coffee. They drawings french press another one I really know was. I guess ask? On counter laminated papers moving around place real menu. All confusing place. 2.0 well picture mimi m."pigging " enough ruin appetite food  . tastes like R&L  frozen crap , change things aware lot people notice ...the pizza ok used better ,  . pizza thing edible.    mimi please pics eating  ! 1.0 racist rock bar typical bayonne bar 1.0 This place truly terrible ....as boy growing I enjoyed food specially buffalo wings food nasty.....maybe hired different cook something need invest new cook something .....food nowhere near good use be. 1.0 HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!! I tried taking teenage daughter last summer celebrate winning cheerleading competetion. We immediatly seated & told server would right us.We waited almost 10min. & (I assume) manager asked ok. I told dying thirst! She asked us would like walked server & told get us. The server walked towards us & distracted friends bar. We waited another 5 min. I frustrated (&hungry) wait anymore. We got & started walk manager (I assume) rushed tell us drinks would right out. I told thank & never returning! 1.0 pizza alright food pretty tough . 2.0 Try thin pizza, best around! 4.0 I love thin pizza thier grilled chicken salad - mention french onion soup.  A really fun place, fresh food, great entertainment. 4.0 Just moved area Florida great find. Sports lounge, pool table, free WiFi, great bartender( Stacy ) short walk away home Great!!! 4.0 This place one favorite bars New Jersey go drink. They always good beer selection bartenders cool seen times take care you. It's great place watch sporting events type, got really nice outdoor tiki lounge chill summer. The clientele definitely colorful that's makes fun. And unlike chill bars I've to, food really great, especially pizza wings. Big thumbs up! I've spent many fun night here. 4.0 The bar side great tvs everywhere, outsides nice feature, food amazing Specially 3 drinks, bar bayonne. Convenient, nice pool table good time friends. Also servers par, u go ask chris. He"s upcoming comedian.  Also ask kim hotttt. And course drink never empty, would u want sports bar. I'd give 10 stars. 5.0 Probably best pizza find town.  If going Big Apple, try famous thin crust Pizza, best around.  Toni Vin run great Sports Bar restaurant next equally well run.  The service always fast food always served hot.  I family several times always enjoy big apple. 5.0 I takeout here. They make great thin crisp pizza. It rivals Star Tavern Orange. Toppings abundant ,great eggplant 4.0 Ordered pick 2x week. Both times food burnt. Called second time complain offered give shitty food told thanks I even want eat. Was asked I wanted $ back I said sure. 3 ppl later nasty woman aid order get $ I needed bring good back. I already wasted time appetite I go back them? No thanks save time patience. 1.0 U drunk eat food They ashamed serve I came pregnant wife stopped eating fear safety un born child They give u paper plates eat ..... 1.0 Delicious Wings! Delicious Thin Pizza! Love spot pig out! 5.0 This 2 1/2 star review. The sad thing is, I go pretty frequently I walk here. If want drink Yuenglings Bud light watch baseball, hockey football, go here. They lot TVs projection screen usually catch Yankees Devils. I care football, I assume watch Giants here. I think people actually like Jets. If want go bar hang act like civilized human being, eat something sustenance, hang Old Man Budweiser Crowd Bayonne Police Department go somewhere else. Lot 13 cool. Venice cool. The food edible, except pizza. But Bayonne land pizza other, better options. I love bar. But closest place apartment. 2.0 I went grab something eat. Mind you, I reviewing bar area since I hang there. I reviewing dinning side. You walk in, see green everywhere: chairs, rug (that looks quite dirty) wallpaper. With said, ambience pretty horrible. I noticed everyone walking could qualify medicare -- within age group, maybe like place. 20-30s, go somewhere else. We sit point, I praying food good. We ordered wings ok, nothing special. My husband ordered pizza good (I would actually consider ordering delivery). I got antipasto salad. It ok. Also menu extensive, pretty regular american cuisine menu. Seems like people go thin crust pizza. The service good, waitress forgot salad, tried play quite obvious. Never got refill drink. Needless say good experience overall. Maybe put dollars fixing place would worth something. As currently stands I would stay away it. 1.0 This place used one favorite sports bars, extent still is. I used come time, great place sit watch sports , got good projectors , giants screens big games good tenders. The bar par absolutely amazing, although recently seems like something different isnt good. But even good normally , still great bar pie.  Thin crusted well done bit crispness. Yumm! That quality night kinda hit miss depending crowd.  Its seems like last years lot older sit corner get nearly pass drunk types. The types either get alittle chatty friendly try hit anything movies yelling it. (Think typical shore guido would 40 years now) But get good crowd still great time people arent getting belligerent . It gets pretty crowded football games come early grab good spot. It makes nice Sunday ,  its Thursday/Friday night sports event going crowd gets weird.  Come weekend Friday night set good time night hit miss. PS huge parking lot around back easy parking. 3.0 Pizza use pretty good quality gone hell.  If decide order delivered make sure advance seems always take hour get food even delivered 15 block away. So expect food stone cold....and I mean cold.  Think eating food sitting table 3 hours eat it.  Very disappointing considering food (albeit bar food)  always lack much quality there. 2.0 This place best thin crust pizza, period. People rave Pete Elda's shore, places around state decent thin crust pizza, THIS real deal. As I understand it, exact pizza recipe used EJ's Bayonne back day. I went EJ's A LOT kid growing Jersey City, confirm really exact stuff. Perfectly cooked thin crust, lots cheese tasty sauce. It's thin crust pizza done right! Don't come fancy decor, prompt professional service, bells whistles. Go PIZZA. This Bayonne, place represents Bayonne pretty accurately, eyes. It's best representation Bayonne thin crust pizza. Go place street want super thin crust. 4.0 worst  pizza I ever had! 1.0 It's good place watch game, beers, apps. There decent menu. I'm fan buffalo blasts Steak Murphy wrap. During warmer months, there's tiki bar. 4.0 I love big apple bar.  It thier thin crusted pizza keeps coming back, best!  if u big appetite order two pies bc crust thin u see it...LOL......i never eaten main course thiere thier appetizers awesome well fried raviolis fried mac cheese bites.....delicious..... basically place good appetizers couple beers course pizza 4.0 Zero stars. This place redeeming qualities whatsoever. Terrible food clientele straight The Hills Have Eyes. 1.0 I like support local businesses I kept seeing commercials Big Apple, I thought would good place go eat. This place divided two areas. The bar, looks nice sporty, dining area, wife I sat. This area looks like old folks home. I say, worst "restaurant" food I ever life. It ran local grocery store, bought frozen food, microwaved gave me. It terrible! The salad chunks lettuce root appealing. I NEVER go back place tell anyone asks place avoid like plague. Is possible give place negative stars? 1.0 VEGETARIANS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!! My boyfriend I regulars State Street location usually satisfied.  They fast, reasonably priced good.  But tonight one worst experiences ever. We ordered usual, vegetable chimichangas everything (meaning rice, black beans, guac pico de gallo) hot sauce sour cream beef chimichangas everything except sour cream hot sauce. Where went wrong... boyfriend eats poultry, beef pork..I eat almost anything except I HATE sour cream like spice hot sauce.  We got 2 containers, one marked "B" unmarked. The one marked "B"  was vegetable unmarked beef hot sauce sour cream. Unfortunately,  for us unmarked one beef hot sauce sour cream boyfriend realize bites meat. He put red meat body 25 yrs, course made sick. Upset, since neither us dinner I called rectify problem.  The person answered spoke little english, trying explain problem issue. I asked anyone spoke english put someone.  This gentleman told thats I ordered kept responding "yeah?" ...So, frustrating minutes offer comp meal, remake right offer us comp next visit, I told lost week customer. WE WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!!! They would've recieved four star reveiw otherwise. 2.0 We went La Carreta lunch closed. So went dinner, fortunately, long trudge, finally sat around table. The restaurant located residential area, quiet peaceful, obscure deep green signboard. It convenient get there, customers (to exact, zero entered). The environment nothing special, comparison Mexican restaurants. There small decorations like picture Mexican man. Not much use bright colors, whole room furniture looked little bit old. There four tables it. I guess possibly provide delivery service. The kitchen main part restaurant, seem used providing table service. We ask silverware, paper napkins. There three four people working restaurant, time cooking food, except one would run customer need. We could see pictures dishes wall, extremely useful foreigners like roommates. The menu piece paper, convenient easy understand. I took one, hoping learn complex names Mexican dishes. Haha... It took 15 minutes dishes served. Not fast, opinion. We 5 people ordered: Chicken Burritos, Beef Burritos. Chicken Quesadillas, Enchiladas Vegetarian Tacos. Burritos American style, one friends commented, tasted good. I found beans, cheese, cabbage chicken fillings, I liked all. Quesadillas soft, strong taste cheese. Another friend felt cheese Mexican - orange color signaled likely cheddar cheese. Enchiladas sweet spicy enough. Vegetarian Tacos full vegetables looked healthy. The flour tortillas served tacos taste extremely fresh. Maybe purchased stored rather made restaurant. We also ordered Mexico-made sodas. Different flavors, different colors, right sweetness, made real sugar, nice change normal soda menus. The price relatively low, portion big. We spent $9 per person, including tips. I managed finish half burritos. In conclusion, though meal authentic expected, tasted bad least worth money paid. The environment service barely satisfactory. 3.0 For price place solid. Cart food restaurant. Cash only. 4.0 best burritos connecticut, love cart yale hockey rink 5.0 This review La Carreta cart Prospect Street Science Hill. I passed food carts years wary trying them. For first one, I chose La Carreta I mood burrito, chicken burrito die for. He warms huge tortilla piles ingredients, tomatoes, cheese, coleslaw/cabbage-kind salad delicious, black beans, rice, chicken, sour cream, such. The burrito fresh far surpasses quality Moe's, local chain Mexican eatery. The huge burrito $4.50 well worth money. 5.0 place flippin amaaaaazing. pork best- tender juicy abundant! menu simple cheap, always prepared perfection. glad close, bc la caretta addiction strooooonnnnng! nom! 5.0 This review cart Med School. I love good taco. Burrito...quesadilla....etcetera. This cart has, far, best tacos I've New Haven! For 6 dollars get rice, beans, three tacos (with toppings/fillings choice), sour cream smoky chipoltle sauce. I crave regular. Stop cart area - disappointed. 4.0 Best tacos New Haven. 5.0 Consistently good fresh actually pretty amazing considering price. The veggie quesadillas awesome--really anything sauteed mushrooms.  The  people working cool patient try pathetic Spanish ordering picking up. Their cart corner Elm Bway great lunch--fast reliable. 5.0 This review specifically cart Cedar St. outside YNHH, standby mine better part decade. Great veggie burritos, great chicken soft tacos, ask politely, lovely woman prepares food make essentially additions substitutions could possibly want. Even catch later afternoon food still fresh good always. 4.0 They food truck serves super mexican food. They've  got seriously great food here. To make even better prices point! 5.0 This perhaps worst Mexican food New Haven. The meat usually chewy prices kinda high. Maybe I compare food trucks Long Wharf c'mon, 3 tacos $7 sort pricey. That's $2.33 taco. Sure provide rice beans tiny portion good. Plus, simplest order usually takes ridiculously long time prepare. Taquerias like place suppose quick painless. But every time I get take-out seems like I caught completely surprise scramble 2,000 miles Mexico cook food. 2.0 I really understand hype food State Street location... It's cool cabbage burritos, that's it. I tried ask chips/guacamole/ chips charged 3$ handful thick crunchy round chips blob "guacamole" definitely bunch sour cream filler it- fresh all.

I got enchiladas mole.  They pretty awful.  The mole  totally tasteless, better taste tortillas used.  The chicken acceptably cooked, rice beans lacked flavor.  The place totally empty I got food, eating I see why.  The place lacked soul (and taste) food! 1.0 Really?  I can't believe people give good reviews!  Especially claim form Cali!  I lived CA too.  Their burritos nearly good ones form Tijuana taco cart!  I live across street La Caretta, I gotten take out, including taco salad.  I can't imagine something unhealthier less authentic.  The reviews I understand ones say price amount food ratio good.  Their burritos ARE cheaper Tijuana's.  The people I know eat frugal male scientists need maximize caloric intake price ratio. 1.0 I restaurant yet, set cart Fair Haven Farmer's Market every Thursday summer early Fall, I look forward getting one delicious quesidillas.  The amount tasty food get five dollars amazing--and make watch.
